title:D_D014262 and C_D016651 D_D064420 in a newborn infant.
abstract:A newborn with massive D_D014262, D_D001282, D_D006333, and a high serum C_D008094 level is described. This is the first patient to initially manifest D_D014262 and D_D001282, and the 11th described patient with D_D006331 among infants exposed to C_D008094 compounds in the first trimester of pregnancy. Sixty-three percent of these infants had tricuspid valve involvement. C_D016651 may be a factor in the increasing incidence of D_D006331 when taken during early pregnancy. It also causes D_D003866, D_D003490, and D_D001145 when consumed prior to delivery.

title:C_D010634-induced D_D004409 in a D_D009422 child.
abstract:A 2-year-old child with known D_D009422 developed a D_D004409 soon after starting C_D010634 therapy for D_D012640. Known causes of D_D009069 were eliminated after evaluation. On repeat challenge with C_D010634, the D_D004409 recurred. C_D010634 should be added to the list of anticonvulsant drugs that can cause D_D009069.

title:Acute changes of blood C_D000641 may predict short-term adverse effects of C_D014635.
abstract:C_D014635 (C_D014635) was given to 24 D_D004827 patients who were already being treated with other antiD_D004827 drugs. A standardized loading dose of C_D014635 was administered, and venous blood was sampled at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours. C_D000641 (C_D000641) was higher in patients who, during continuous therapy, complained of D_D006970 (7 patients) than in those who were symptom-free (17 patients), although C_D014635 plasma levels were similar in both groups. By measuring C_D014635-induced changes of blood C_D000641 content, it may be possible to identify patients at higher risk of obtundation when C_D014635 is given chronically.

title:Effects of calcitonin on rat extrapyramidal motor system: behavioral and biochemical data.
abstract:The effects of i.v.c. injection of human and salmon calcitonin on biochemical and behavioral parameters related to the extrapyramidal motor system, were investigated in male rats. Calcitonin injection resulted in a potentiation of C_D006220-induced D_D002375 and a partial prevention of C_D001058-induced D_D006948. Moreover calcitonin induced a significant decrease in nigral GAD activity but no change in striatal C_D004298 and C_D015102 concentration or GAD activity. The results are discussed in view of a primary action of calcitonin on the striatonigral GABAergic pathway mediating the C_D004298-related behavioral messages of striatal origin.

title:Development of C_D007545-induced D_D006332.
abstract:The development of D_D006332 was studied in adult female Wistar rats following daily subcutaneous injections of C_D007545 (C_D007545) (0.3 mg/kg body weight). A time course was established for the change in tissue mass, RNA and DNA content, as well as C_D006909 content. Heart weight increased 44% after 8 days of treatment with a half time of 3.4 days. Ventricular RNA content was elevated 26% after 24 h of a single injection and reached a maximal level following 8 days of therapy. The half time for RNA accumulation was 2.0 days. The total content of C_D006909 remained stable during the first 2 days of treatment but increased 46% after 4 days of therapy. Ventricular DNA content was unchanged during the early stage (1-4 days) of D_D006984 growth but increased to a new steady-state level 19% above the controls after 8 days of treatment. Intraventricular pressures and coronary flow measures were similar for control and experimental animals following 4 days of developed D_D006984. However, dP/dt in the C_D007545-treated hearts was slightly but significantly (P less than 0.05) elevated. These data indicate that the adaptive response to C_D007545 shows an early D_D006984 phase (1-4 days) characterized by a substantial increase in RNA content and cardiac mass in the absence of changes in DNA. However, prolonged stimulation (8-12 days) appears to represent a complex integration of both cellular D_D006984 and D_D006965 within the heart.

title:Co-D_D063646 effect of C_C009166 on D_D013274 of male F344 rats induced with C_D002083.
abstract:The potential modifying effect of C_C009166 (C_C009166) on C_D002083 (C_D002083)-induced rat D_D013274 was examined. Male F344 rats, 5 weeks of age, were maintained on diet containing 1% or 2% C_D002083 by weight and simultaneously on drinking water supplemented with C_C009166 at various concentrations (w/v) for 52 weeks. In groups given 2% C_D002083, although marked hyperplastic changes of the forestomach epithelium were observed in all animals, co-administration of 0.25% C_C009166 significantly (P less than 0.05) increased the incidence of D_D013274 (D_D010212 and D_D002277) to 60% (9/15, 2 rats with D_D002277) from 15% (3/20, one rat with D_D002277) in the group given C_C009166-free water. In rats given 1% C_D002083, C_C009166 co-administered at a dose of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 or 0.25% showed a dose-dependent enhancing effect on the development of the C_D002083-induced D_D017573. D_D009369, all D_D010212, were induced in 3 rats (17%) with 0.25% C_C009166 and in one rat (10%) with 0.05% C_C009166 co-administration. C_C009166 alone did not induce hyperplastic changes in the forestomach. These findings indicate that C_C009166 acted as a co-carcinogen in the C_D002083 D_D013274 of the rat.

title:C_D007650 pretreatment reverses C_D015760-induced D_D009127.
abstract:Systemic pretreatment with C_D007650, a relatively specific type-2 C_D012701 receptor antagonist, significantly attenuated the D_D009127 produced in rats by the potent short-acting opiate agonist C_D015760. Following placement of subcutaneous electrodes in each animal's left gastrocnemius muscle, D_D009127 was assessed by analyzing root-mean-square electromyographic activity. Intraperitoneal C_D007650 administration at doses of 0.63 and 2.5 mg/kg prevented the C_D015760-induced increase in electromyographic activity compared with animals pretreated with saline. C_D002707 at doses up to 10 mg/kg failed to significantly influence the D_D009127 produced by C_D015760. Despite the absence of D_D009127, animals that received C_D007650 (greater than 0.31 mg/kg i.p.) followed by C_D015760 were motionless, flaccid, and less responsive to external stimuli than were animals receiving C_D015760 alone. Rats that received C_D007650 and C_D015760 exhibited less rearing and exploratory behavior at the end of the 60-min recording period than did animals that received C_D007650 alone. These results, in combination with previous work, suggest that D_D009127, a clinically relevant side-effect of parenteral narcotic administration, may be partly mediated via serotonergic pathways. Pretreatment with type-2 C_D012701 antagonists may be clinically useful in attenuating opiate-induced D_D009127, although further studies will be necessary to assess the interaction of possibly enhanced CNS, cardiovascular, and respiratory depression.

title:C_D006024 requirements for antagonism of the muscarinic side effects of C_D004491.
abstract:We have compared, in 60 adult patients, the cardiovascular effects of C_D006024 5 micrograms kg-1 and 10 micrograms kg-1 given either simultaneously or 1 min before C_D004491 1 mg kg-1. Significant differences between the four groups were detected (P less than 0.001). Both groups receiving 10 micrograms kg-1 showed increases in heart rate of up to 30 beat min-1 (95% confidence limits 28-32 beat min-1). Use of C_D006024 5 micrograms kg-1 provided greater cardiovascular stability and, given 1 min before the C_D004491, was sufficient to minimize early, C_D004491-induced D_D001919. This low dose of C_D006024 provided good control of oropharyngeal secretions.

title:Involvement of locus coeruleus and noradrenergic neurotransmission in C_D005283-induced D_D009127 in the rat.
abstract:Whereas D_D009127 is a well-known side effect that is associated with high-dose C_D005283 anesthesia, a paucity of information exists with regard to its underlying mechanism(s). We investigated in this study the possible engagement of locus coeruleus of the pons in this phenomenon, using male Sprague-Dawley rats anesthetized with C_D007649. Under proper control of respiration, body temperature and end-tidal C_D002245, intravenous administration of C_D005283 (50 or 100 micrograms/kg) consistently promoted an increase in electromyographic activity recorded from the gastrocnemius and abdominal rectus muscles. Such an induced D_D009127 by the narcotic agent was significantly antagonized or even reduced by prior electrolytic lesions of the locus coeruleus or pretreatment with the alpha-adrenoceptor blocker, C_D011224. Microinjection of C_D005283 (2.5 micrograms/50 nl) directly into this pontine nucleus, on the other hand, elicited discernible electromyographic excitation. It is speculated that the induction of D_D009127 by C_D005283 may involve the coerulospinal noradrenergic fibers to the spinal motoneurons.

This antifibrinolytic agent has been used in women with D_D008595 to promote clotting and reduce D_D006473. Although increased risk of D_D013923 has been reported during treatment with C_D015119, D_D012851 has not been previously described. Careful use of C_D015119 therapy is recommended.

title:Hemorrhagic cystitis complicating bone marrow transplantation.
abstract:Hemorrhagic cystitis is a potentially serious complication of high-dose C_D003520 therapy administered before bone marrow transplantation. As standard practice at our institution, patients who are scheduled to receive a bone marrow transplant are treated prophylactically with forced hydration and bladder irrigation. In an attempt to obviate the inconvenience of bladder irrigation, we conducted a feasibility trial of uroprophylaxis with C_D015080, which neutralizes the hepatic metabolite of C_D003520 that causes hemorrhagic cystitis. Of 97 patients who received standard prophylaxis, 4 had symptomatic hemorrhagic cystitis. In contrast, two of four consecutive patients who received C_D015080 uroprophylaxis before allogeneic bone marrow transplantation had severe hemorrhagic cystitis for at least 2 weeks. Because of this suboptimal result, we resumed the use of bladder irrigation and forced hydration to minimize the risk of hemorrhagic cystitis.

abstract:The efficacy and safety of a new C_D001569 antagonist, C_D005442, were assessed in a double-blind multicenter study. C_D005442 (mean dose, 0.76 mg) or placebo (mean dose, 8.9 ml) was administered intravenously to 130 and 67 patients, respectively, who had been given C_D003975 in conjunction with an opioid (C_D005283, C_D008614, or C_D009020) for the induction and maintenance of intravenous conscious sedation for diagnostic or therapeutic surgical procedures. The group assessable for efficacy comprised 122 patients treated with C_D005442 and 64 patients given placebo. After 5 minutes, 80/115 (70%) C_D005442-treated patients, compared with 21/63 (33%) placebo-treated patients, were completely awake and alert, as indicated by a score of 5 on the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale. Ninety-five percent of patients in each group who attained a score of 5 at the 5-minute assessment showed no loss of alertness throughout the 180-minute assessment period. C_D005442-treated patients also performed significantly better on the Finger-to-Nose Test and the recall of pictures shown at the 5-minute assessment. C_D005442 was well tolerated, with no serious adverse effects reported. Thirty-nine (30%) of C_D005442-treated patients, compared with 17 (25%) of placebo-treated patients had one or more drug-related adverse experiences. The most common adverse effects were D_D009325 and D_D014839 in the C_D005442 group and D_D009325 and injection-site D_D010146 in the placebo group. C_D005442 was found to promptly reverse sedation induced by C_D003975 in the presence of opioids.

title:Arterial D_D013923 in patients receiving systemic C_D006493 therapy: a complication associated with C_D006493-induced D_D013921.
abstract:Arterial D_D013923 is a recognized complication of systemic C_D006493 therapy. Characteristic of the entity is D_D001157 by platelet-fibrin D_D013927 with distal D_D007511 occurring four to twenty days after the initiation of C_D006493 therapy, preceded by profound D_D013921 with platelet counts in the range of 30,000 to 40,000 per cubic millimeter. The clinically apparent occlusion may be preceded by gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal symptoms that appear to be D_D007511 in origin, and might serve to warn the clinician of these complications. Previous reports of these phenomena as well as recent studies of the effect of C_D006493 are reviewed. The common factor relating D_D013923 and D_D013921 is C_D006493-induced D_D001791. Appropriate treatment consists of discontinuation of C_D006493, and anticoagulation with C_D014859 if necessary. Vascular procedures are performed as indicated.

title:Long-term prognosis for transplant-free survivors of C_D000082-induced D_D017114.
abstract:BACKGROUND: The prognosis for transplant-free survivors of C_D000082-induced D_D017114 remains unknown. AIM: To examine whether C_D000082-induced D_D017114 increases long-term mortality. METHODS: We followed up all transplant-free survivors of C_D000082-induced D_D056486, hospitalized in a Danish national referral centre during 1984-2004. We compared age-specific mortality rates from 1 year post-discharge through 2008 between those in whom the D_D056486 led to an D_D017114 and those in whom it did not. RESULTS: We included 641 patients. On average, age-specific mortality rates were slightly higher for the 101 patients whose C_D000082-induced D_D056486 had caused an D_D017114 (adjusted mortality rate ratio = 1.70, 95% CI 1.02-2.85), but the association was age-dependent, and no survivors of D_D017114 died of D_D008107, whereas suicides were frequent in both groups. These observations speak against long-term effects of D_D017114. More likely, the elevated mortality rate ratio resulted from incomplete adjustment for the greater prevalence of D_D019966 among survivors of D_D017114. CONCLUSIONS: C_D000082-induced D_D017114 did not affect long-term mortality. Clinical follow-up may be justified by the cause of the D_D017093, but not by the D_D017093 itself.

title:C_D012701 6 receptor gene is associated with C_D008694-induced D_D011605 in a Japanese population.
abstract:BACKGROUND: Altered serotonergic neural transmission is hypothesized to be a susceptibility factor for D_D011605 such as D_D012559. The C_D012701 6 (C_D0127016) receptor is therapeutically targeted by several second generation antipsychotics, such as C_D003024 and C_C076029, and C_D003913-induced D_D006948 in rats is corrected with the use of a selective C_D0127016 receptor antagonist. In addition, the disrupted prepulse inhibition induced by C_D003913 or C_D010622 was restored by C_D0127016 receptor antagonist in an animal study using rats. These animal models were considered to reflect the positive symptoms of D_D012559, and the above evidence suggests that altered C_D0127016 receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of D_D011605. The symptoms of C_D008694 (C_D008694)-induced D_D011605 are similar to those of paranoid type D_D012559. Therefore, we conducted an analysis of the association of the C_D0127016 gene (HTR6) with C_D008694-induced D_D011605. C_D008694OD: Using five tagging SNPs (rs6693503, rs1805054, rs4912138, rs3790757 and rs9659997), we conducted a genetic association analysis of case-control samples (197 C_D008694-induced D_D011605 patients and 337 controls) in the Japanese population. The age and sex of the control subjects did not differ from those of the C_D008694 dependence patients. RESULTS: rs6693503 was associated with C_D008694-induced D_D011605 patients in the allele/genotype-wise analysis. Moreover, this association remained significant after Bonferroni correction. In the haplotype-wise analysis, we detected an association between two markers (rs6693503 and rs1805054) and three markers (rs6693503, rs1805054 and rs4912138) in HTR6 and C_D008694-induced D_D011605 patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: HTR6 may play an important role in the pathophysiology of C_D008694-induced D_D011605 in the Japanese population.

title:Effect of increasing intraperitoneal infusion rates on C_D016642-induced D_D012640 in mice.
abstract:BACKGROUND: It is not known if there is a relationship between input rate and incidence of C_D016642-induced D_D012640. This is important, since different controlled release formulations of C_D016642 release the active drug at different rates. METHODS: We investigated the effect of varying the intraperitoneal infusion rates of C_D016642 HCl 120 mg/kg, a known D_D012640 dose 50 (CD50), on the incidence and severity of C_D016642-induced D_D012640 in the Swiss albino mice. A total of 69 mice, approximately 7 weeks of age, and weighing 21.0 to 29.1 g were randomly assigned to C_D016642 HCl 120 mg/kg treatment by intraperitoneal (IP) administration in 7 groups (9 to 10 animals per group). C_D016642 was infused through a surgically implanted IP dosing catheter with infusions in each group of 0 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min, and 240 min. The number, time of onset, duration and the intensity of the D_D012640 or absence of D_D012640 were recorded. RESULTS: The results showed that IP administration of C_D016642 HCl 120 mg/kg by bolus injection induced D_D012640 in 6 out of 10 mice (60% of convulsing mice) in group 1. Logistic regression analysis revealed that infusion time was significant (p = 0.0004; odds ratio = 0.974) and increasing the IP infusion time of C_D016642 HCl 120 mg/kg was associated with a 91% reduced odds of D_D012640 at infusion times of 15 to 90 min compared to bolus injection. Further increase in infusion time resulted in further reduction in the odds of D_D012640 to 99.8% reduction at 240 min. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the demonstration of an inverse relationship between infusion time of a fixed and D_D012640 dose of C_D016642 and the risk of D_D012640 in a prospective study is novel.

title:Detailed spectral profile analysis of C_D010406-induced D_D004827 in anesthetized rats.
abstract:C_D010406 model is a widely used experimental model for D_D004827 research. In the present study we aimed to portray a detailed spectral analysis of C_D010406-induced D_D004827 in comparison with basal brain activity in anesthetized Wistar rats. Male Wistar rats were anesthetized with i.p. C_D014520 and connected to an electrocorticogram setup. After a short period of basal activity recording, D_D004827 focus was induced by injecting 400IU/2 microl C_D010406-G potassium into the left lateral ventricle while the cortical activity was continuously recorded. Basal activity, latent period and the C_D010406-induced D_D004827 periods were then analyzed using both conventional methods and spectral analysis. Spectral analyses were conducted by dividing the whole spectrum into different frequency bands including delta, theta (slow and fast), alpha-sigma, beta (1 and 2) and gamma (1 and 2) bands. Our results show that the most affected frequency bands were delta, theta, beta-2 and gamma-2 bands during the D_D004827 and there were marked differences in terms of spectral densities between three investigated episodes (basal activity, latent period and D_D004827). Our results may help to analyze novel data obtained using similar experimental models and the simple analysis method described here can be used in similar studies to investigate the basic neuronal mechanism of this or other types of experimental D_D004827.

title:High dose C_D020927 as the sole sedative for pediatric MRI.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: This large-scale retrospective review evaluates the sedation profile of C_D020927. AIM: To determine the hemodynamic responses, efficacy and adverse events associated with the use of high dose C_D020927 as the sole sedative for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. BACKGROUND: C_D020927 has been used at our institution since 2005 to provide sedation for pediatric radiological imaging studies. Over time, an effective protocol utilizing high dose C_D020927 as the sole sedative agent has evolved. METHODS/MATERIALS: As part of the ongoing Quality Assurance process, data on all sedations are reviewed monthly and protocols modified as needed. Data were analyzed from all 747 consecutive patients who received C_D020927 for MRI sedation from April 2005 to April 2007. RESULTS: Since 2005, the 10-min loading dose of our C_D020927 protocol increased from 2 to 3 microg.kg(-1), and the infusion rate increased from 1 to 1.5 to 2 microg.kg(-1).h(-1). The current sedation protocol progressively increased the rate of successful sedation (able to complete the imaging study) when using C_D020927 alone from 91.8% to 97.6% (P = 0.009), reducing the requirement for adjuvant C_D010424 in the event of sedation failure with C_D020927 alone and decreased the mean recovery time by 10 min (P < 0.001). Although C_D020927 sedation was associated with a 16% incidence of D_D001919, all concomitant mean arterial blood pressures were within 20% of age-adjusted normal range and C_D010100 saturations were 95% or higher. CONCLUSION: C_D020927 in high doses provides adequate sedation for pediatric MRI studies. While use of high dose C_D020927 is associated with decreases in heart rate and blood pressure outside the established 'awake' norms, this deviation is generally within 20% of norms, and is not associated with adverse sequelae. C_D020927 is useful as the sole sedative for pediatric MRI.

title:C_D008694 causes alterations in the MAP kinase-related pathways in the brains of mice that display increased D_D001523.
abstract:D_D001523 have been reported in patients who suffer from some D_D001523, and are common in C_D008694 (C_D008694) abusers. Herein, we report that multiple (but not single) injections of C_D008694 significantly increased D_D001523 in male CD-1 mice. This increase in D_D001523 was not secondary to C_D008694-induced D_D006948. Analysis of protein expression using antibody microarrays and Western blotting revealed differential changes in MAP kinase-related pathways after multiple and single C_D008694 injections. There were statistically significant (p<0.05) decreases in MEK1, Erk2p, GSK3alpha, 14-3-3e, and MEK7 in the striata of mice after multiple injections of C_D008694. MEK1 was significantly decreased also after a single injection of C_D008694, but to a much lesser degree than after multiple injections of C_D008694. In the frontal cortex, there was a statistically significant decrease in GSK3alpha after multiple (but not single) injections of C_D008694. These findings suggest that alterations in MAP kinase-related pathways in the prefronto-striatal circuitries might be involved in the manifestation of D_D001523 in mice.

title:C_C047781 associated with exacerbation or de novo D_D009207 in D_C562694.
abstract:Five patients with D_C562694 (D_C562694) treated with C_C047781 (C_C047781) experienced exacerbation or de novo appearance of D_D009207 (D_D009207). In three patients, C_C047781 exacerbated D_D009207 in a dose-dependent manner with early aggravation during titration. D_D009207 disappeared when C_C047781 dose was decreased by 25 to 50%. In two patients, C_C047781 exacerbated D_D009207 in a delayed but more severe manner, with D_D009207 that only ceased after C_C047781 withdrawal.

title:rTMS of supplementary motor area modulates therapy-induced D_D004409 in D_D010300.
abstract:The neural mechanisms and circuitry involved in C_D007980-induced D_D004409 are unclear. Using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the supplementary motor area (SMA) in a group of patients with advanced D_D010300, the authors investigated whether modulation of SMA excitability may result in a modification of a D_D004409 state induced by continuous C_D001058 infusion. rTMS at 1 Hz was observed to markedly reduce drug-induced D_D004409, whereas 5-Hz rTMS induced a slight but not significant increase.

title:Assessment of the onset and persistence of D_D000647 during procedural sedation with C_D015742.
abstract:OBJECTIVES: To assess patients' ability to repeat and recall words presented to them while undergoing procedural sedation with C_D015742, and correlate their recall with their level of awareness as measured by bispectral index (BIS) monitoring. METHODS: This was a prospective, single-intervention study of consenting adult patients undergoing procedural sedation with C_D015742 between December 28, 2002, and October 31, 2003. BIS monitoring was initiated starting 3 minutes before the procedure and continuing until the patient had regained baseline mental status. At 1-minute intervals during the procedural sedation, until the patient regained baseline mental status at the end of the procedure, a word from a standardized list was read aloud, and the patient was asked to immediately repeat the word to the investigator. The BIS score at the time the word was read and the patient's ability to repeat the word were recorded. After the procedure, the patient was asked to state all of the words from the list that he or she could recall, and to identify the last word recalled from prior to the start of the procedure and the first word recalled from after the procedure was completed. RESULTS: Seventy-five consenting patients were enrolled; one patient was excluded from data analysis for a protocol violation. No serious adverse events were noted during the procedural sedations. The mean (+/-standard deviation) time of data collection was 16.4 minutes (+/-7.1; range 5 to 34 minutes). The mean initial (preprocedure) BIS score was 97.1 (+/-2.3; range 92 to 99). The mean lowest BIS score occurring during these procedural sedations was 66.9 (+/-14.4; range 33 to 91). The mean lowest BIS score corresponding to the ability of the patient to immediately repeat words read from the list was 77.1 (95% CI = 74.3 to 80.0). The mean highest BIS score corresponding to the D_D000647 was 81.5 (95% CI = 78.1 to 84.8). The mean BIS score corresponding to the last word recalled from prior to the initiation of the sedation was 96.7 (+/-2.4; range 84 to 98). The mean BIS score corresponding to the first word recalled after the procedure was completed was 91.2 (95% CI = 88.1 to 94.3). All patients recalled at least one word that had been read to them during the protocol. The mean lowest BIS score for any recalled word was 91.5 (+/-11.1; range 79 to 98), and no words were recalled when the corresponding BIS score was less than 90. CONCLUSIONS: There is a range of BIS scores during which sedated patients are able to repeat words read to them but are not able to subsequently recall these words. Furthermore, patients had no recall of words repeated prior to procedural sedation in BIS ranges associated with recall after procedural sedation, suggestive of retrograde D_D000647.

title:Assessment of perinatal D_D006509 and D_D012409 prevention in New Hampshire delivery hospitals.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: To evaluate current performance on recommended perinatal D_D006509 and D_D012409 prevention practices in New Hampshire. METHODS: Data were extracted from 2021 paired mother-infant records for the year 2000 birth cohort in New Hampshire's 25 delivery hospitals. Assessment was done on the following: prenatal screening for D_D006509 and D_D012409, administration of the D_D006509 vaccine birth dose to all infants, administration of D_D006509 immune globulin to infants who were born to D_D006509 surface antigen-positive mothers, D_D012409 immunity, and administration of in-hospital postpartum D_D012409 vaccine to D_D012409 nonimmune women. RESULTS: Prenatal screening rates for D_D006509 (98.8%) and D_D012409 (99.4%) were high. D_D006509 vaccine birth dose was administered to 76.2% of all infants. All infants who were born to D_D006509 surface antigen-positive mothers also received D_D006509 immune globulin. Multivariate logistic regression showed that the month of delivery and infant birth weight were independent predictors of D_D006509 vaccination. The proportion of infants who were vaccinated in January and February 2000 (48.5% and 67.5%, respectively) was less than any other months, whereas the proportion who were vaccinated in December 2000 (88.2%) was the highest. Women who were born between 1971 and 1975 had the highest rate of D_D012409 nonimmunity (9.5%). In-hospital postpartum D_D012409 vaccine administration was documented for 75.6% of nonimmune women. CONCLUSION: This study documents good compliance in New Hampshire's birthing hospitals with national guidelines for perinatal D_D006509 and D_D012409 prevention and highlights potential areas for improvement.

title:Expression of p300 protects cardiac myocytes from apoptosis in vivo.
abstract:C_D004317 is an anti-D_D009369 agent that represses cardiac-specific gene expression and induces myocardial cell apoptosis. C_D004317 depletes cardiac p300, a transcriptional coactivator that is required for the maintenance of the differentiated phenotype of cardiac myocytes. However, the role of p300 in protection against C_D004317-induced apoptosis is unknown. Transgenic mice overexpressing p300 in the heart and wild-type mice were subjected to C_D004317 treatment. Compared with wild-type mice, transgenic mice exhibited higher survival rate as well as more preserved left ventricular function and cardiac expression of alpha-sarcomeric actin. C_D004317 induced myocardial cell apoptosis in wild-type mice but not in transgenic mice. Expression of p300 increased the cardiac level of bcl-2 and mdm-2, but not that of p53 or other members of the bcl-2 family. These findings demonstrate that overexpression of p300 protects cardiac myocytes from C_D004317-induced apoptosis and reduces the extent of acute D_D006333 in adult mice in vivo.

title:Mitochondrial DNA and its respiratory chain products are defective in C_D004317 D_D009401.
abstract:BACKGROUND: C_D004317 induces a self-perpetuating D_D007674 characterized by early D_D007674 in rats. We investigated the potential role of D_D028361 in the onset of these lesions. METHODS: Rats were treated with intravenous C_D004317 (1 mg kg(-1) week(-1)) for 7 weeks and were sacrificed either 1 week ('short-term') or 30 weeks ('long-term') following the last dose. Additional rats received a single dose either 6 days or 2 h prior to euthanasia. All rats were killed at 48 weeks of age. D_D007674 was monitored and correlated to the activity or expression of respiratory chain components. Finally, we quantified both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as well as C_D013481 production and the 4834 base pair 'common' mtDNA deletion. RESULTS: The 'long-term' group had significant D_D007674, depressed activities of mtDNA-encoded NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome-c oxidase (COX) and increased C_C102006 synthase activity. In addition, expression of the mtDNA-encoded COX subunit I was reduced and mtDNA levels were decreased. In 'short-term' rats, there were fewer D_D007674, but similar numbers of D_D007674 activity. Among all animals, D_D007674 were inversely correlated with mtDNA levels, mtDNA-encoded respiratory chain activities and with the expression of the mtDNA-encoded respiratory chain subunit COX-I. Injury was positively correlated with C_D013481 production and the activities of nucleus-encoded mitochondrial or cytoplasmic enzymes. Kidneys from the 'long-term' group showed more mtDNA deletions than in 'short-term' animals and these were not observed in the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest an important role for quantitative and qualitative mtDNA alterations through the reduction of mtDNA-encoded respiratory chain function and induction of C_D013481 in C_D004317-induced D_D007674.

title:C_D000666-induced D_D012640 in a patient with D_D000163.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: To report a case of multiple episodes of D_D012640 activity in an D_D000163 patent following C_D000666 infusion. CASE SUMMARY: A 46-year-old African-American man experienced recurrent grand mal D_D012640 during intravenous infusion of C_D000666, then petit mal D_D012640 as the infusion was stopped and the drug concentrations decreased with time. The patients concurrent medications included C_D016049, C_D006919, C_D011398, C_D006854, and C_D011346. Despite administration of C_D010672 and C_D008140, the D_D012640 persisted and occurred only during C_D000666 administration. DISCUSSION: D_D000163 and D_D016919, both of which the patient had, can potentially cause D_D012640. The patient had a history of D_D000437; C_D000431 intake as well as withdrawal can also cause D_D012640. C_D016049 also has a potential for inducing D_D012640. However, these other potential causes of D_D012640 were ruled out. The time course of events suggested that C_D000666 was the cause of the D_D012640 in this D_D000163 patient. CONCLUSIONS: C_D000666 seems to be the probable cause of the D_D012640. To date, only three cases of D_D012640 associated with C_D000666 have been reported in the literature, but healthcare providers should be aware of the potential for this rare adverse effect.

title:Therapeutic drug monitoring of C_D014031: once-daily versus twice-daily dosage schedules.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of dosage regimen (once-daily vs. twice-daily) of C_D014031 on steady-state serum concentrations and D_D064420. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing treatment with i.v. C_D014031 (4 mg/kg/day) were randomised to two groups. Group OD (n = 22) received a once-daily dose of C_D014031 and group TD (n = 21) received the same dose divided into two doses daily. C_D014031 serum concentrations (peak and trough) were measured by enzyme multiplied immunoassay. The renal and auditory functions of the patients were monitored before, during and immediately after treatment. RESULTS: The two groups were comparable with respect to sex, age, body weight and renal function. No statistically significant differences were found in mean daily dose, duration of treatment, or cumulative dose. Trough concentrations were < 2 g/ml in the two groups (100%). Peak concentrations were > 6 microg/ml in 100% of the OD group and in 67% of the TD group (P< 0.01). Mean peak concentrations were markedly different: 11.00+/-2.89 microg/ml in OD vs. 6.53+/-1.45 microg/ml in TD (P< 0.01). The pharmacokinetics parameters were: Ke, (0.15+/-0.03/h in OD vs. 0.24+/-0.06/h in TD), t1/2, (4.95+/-1.41 h in OD vs. 3.07+/-0.71 h in TD), Vd (0.35+/-0.11 l/kg in OD vs. 0.33+/-0.09 l/kg in TD), Cl (0.86+/-0.29 ml/min/kg in OD vs. 1.28+/-0.33 ml/min/kg in TD). Increased serum C_D003404 was observed in 73% of patients in OD versus 57% of patients in TD, without evidence of nephroD_D064420. In TD group, three patients developed D_D034381, of which one presented with an D_D034381 of -30 dB, whereas in the OD group only one patient presented D_D034381. CONCLUSION: This small study suggests that a once-daily dosing regimen of C_D014031 is at least as effective as and is no more and possibly less toxic than the twice-daily regimen. Using a single-dose therapy, peak concentration determination is not necessary, only trough samples should be monitored to ensure levels below 2 microg/ml.

title:Chronic effects of a novel synthetic C_D018943 derivative (C_C055866) on normal heart and C_D004317-induced D_D009202 in beagle dogs.
abstract:This study was designed to investigate the chronic D_D066126 potential of C_C055866 and a possible deteriorating effect of C_C055866 on low-grade D_D066126ity pre-induced by C_D004317 in beagle dogs. In the chronic treatment, beagle dogs of each sex were given intravenously once every 3 weeks, either a sublethal dose of C_D004317 (1.5 mg/kg) or C_C055866 (2.5 mg/kg). The experiment was terminated 3 weeks after the ninth dosing. Animals which received over six courses of C_D004317 demonstrated the electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, decrease of blood pressure and high-grade histopathological D_D009202, while animals which were terminally sacrificed after the C_C055866 administration did not show any changes in ECG, blood pressure and histopathological examinations. To examine a possibly deteriorating D_D066126 effect of C_C055866, low-grade D_D009202 was induced in dogs by four courses of C_D004317 (1.5 mg/kg). Nine weeks after pre-treatment, dogs were given four courses of either C_D004317 (1.5 mg/kg) or C_C055866 (2.5 mg/kg) once every 3 weeks. The low-grade D_D066126 changes were enhanced by the additional C_D004317 treatment. On the contrary, the C_C055866 treatment did not progress the grade of D_D009202. In conclusion, C_C055866 does not have any potential of chronic D_D066126ity and deteriorating effect on C_D004317-induced D_D066126ity in dogs.

title:Posteroventral medial pallidotomy in advanced D_D010300.
abstract:BACKGROUND: Posteroventral medial pallidotomy sometimes produces striking improvement in patients with advanced D_D010300, but the studies to date have involved small numbers of patients and short-term follow-up. METHODS: Forty patients with D_D010300 underwent serial, detailed assessments both after drug withdrawal ("off" period) and while taking their optimal medical regimens ("on" period). All patients were examined preoperatively and 39 were examined at six months; 27 of the patients were also examined at one year, and 11 at two years. RESULTS: The percent improvements at six months were as follows: off-period score for overall motor function, 28 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 38 percent), with most of the improvement in the contralateral limbs; off-period score for activities of daily living, 29 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 39 percent); on-period score for contralateral D_D004409, 82 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 72 to 91 percent); and on-period score for ipsilateral D_D004409, 44 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 29 to 59 percent). The improvements in D_D004409 and the total scores for off-period D_D010300, contralateral D_D018476, and D_D009127 were sustained in the 11 patients examined at two years. The improvement in ipsilateral D_D004409 was lost after one year, and the improvements in postural stability and gait lasted only three to six months. Approximately half the patients who had been dependent on assistance in activities of daily living in the off period before surgery became independent after surgery. The complications of surgery were generally well tolerated, and there were no significant changes in the use of medication. CONCLUSIONS: In late-stage D_D010300, pallidotomy significantly reduces C_D007980-induced D_D004409 and off-period disability. Much of the benefit is sustained at two years, although some improvements, such as those on the ipsilateral side and in axial symptoms, wane within the first year. The on-period symptoms that are resistant to dopaminergic therapy do not respond to pallidotomy.

title:Neuropeptide-Y immunoreactivity in the C_D010862 model of D_D004833.
abstract:Neuropeptide-Y (NPY) is expressed by granule cells and mossy fibres of the hippocampal dentate gyrus during experimental D_D004833 (D_D004833). This expression may represent an endogenous damping mechanism since NPY has been shown to block D_D012640-like events following high-frequency stimulation in hippocampal slices. The C_D010862 (C_D010862) model of D_D004827 is characterized by an acute period of D_D013226 followed by spontaneous recurrent D_D012640s and related D_D001930. We report peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunostaining for NPY in several brain regions in this model. C_D010862-injected animals exhibited NPY immunoreactivity in the region of the mossy fibre terminals, in the dentate gyrus inner molecular layer and, in a few cases, within presumed granule cells. NPY immunoreactivity was also dramatically changed in the entorhinal cortex, amygdala and sensorimotor areas. In addition, C_D010862 injected animals exhibited a reduction in the number of NPY-immunoreactive interneurons compared with controls. The results demonstrate that changes in NPY expression, including expression in the granule cells and mossy fibres and the loss of vulnerable NPY neurons, are present in the C_D010862 model of D_D004833. However, the significance of this changed synthesis of NPY remains to be determined.

title:Effect of myopic excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy on the electrophysiologic function of the retina and optic nerve.
abstract:PURPOSE: To assess by electrophysiologic testing the effect of photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) on the retina and optic nerve. SETTING: Eye Clinic, S. Salvatore Hospital, L'Aquila University, Italy. METHODS: Standard pattern electroretinograms (P-ERGs) and standard pattern visual evoked potentials (P-VEPs) were done in 25 eyes of 25 patients who had myopic PRK for an attempted correction between 5.00 and 15.00 diopters (D) (mean 8.00 D). Testing was done preoperatively and 3, 6, 12, and 18 months postoperatively. The contralateral eyes served as controls. During the follow-up, 3 patients (12%) developed C_D013256-induced D_D009798 (IOP) that resolved after corticoC_D013256 therapy was discontinued. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were seen between treated and control eyes nor between treated eyes preoperatively and postoperatively. CONCLUSION: Myopic excimer laser PRK did not seem to affect the posterior segment. The transient C_D013256-induced D_D009798 did not seem to cause functional impairment.

abstract:We report a non-randomized Phase II clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of liposomal C_D003630 (DaunoXome) in the treatment of D_D000163 related D_D012514. Eleven homosexual men with advanced D_D012514 were entered in the trial. Changes in size, colour and associated D_D004487 of selected 'target' lesions were measured. Clinical, biochemical and haematological D_D064420 were assessed. Ten subjects were evaluated. A partial response was achieved in four, of whom two subsequently relapsed. Stabilization of D_D012514 occurred in the remaining six, maintained until the end of the trial period in four. The drug was generally well tolerated, with few mild symptoms of D_D064420. The main problem encountered was haematological D_D064420, with three subjects experiencing severe D_D009503 (neutrophil count < 0.5 x 10(9)/l). There was no evidence of cardioD_D064420. In this small patient sample, liposomal C_D003630 was an effective and well tolerated agent in the treatment of D_D012514.

Scatter diagrams of the g ratio (quotient fibre diameter/axon diameter) define regenerating fibres as a distinct population, distinguishable from the surviving fibres by reduced sheath thickness and reduced axon calibre. There was also evidence of a subtle direct toxic effect on the entire fibre population, causing axon shrinkage masked by readjustment of the myelin sheath.

abstract:In twenty beagle dogs selective injections were made into the left coronary artery with C_C053571, C_D007472 and C_D008794 in doses of 4 ml, 8 ml and 16 ml. Thirty-six C_C053571 injections, 35 C_D007472 injections and 37 C_D008794 injections were made. Frequencies of D_D014693 were significantly lower (p less than 0.05) after C_C053571 (0%) and C_D007472 (3%) than after C_D008794 (22%). C_C053571 and C_D007472 also produced significantly less decrease in aortic blood pressure than C_D008794 at the different doses.

title:Magnetic resonance imaging of cerebral D_D020246 secondary to "low-dose" birth control pills.
abstract:The clinical and radiographic features of cerebral deep D_D020246 in a 21-year-old white woman are presented. This nulliparous patient presented with relatively mild clinical symptoms and progressing mental status changes. The only known risk factor was "low-dose" C_D003276 pills. The magnetic resonance image (MRI) showed increased signal intensity from the internal cerebral veins, vein of Galen, and straight sinus. The diagnosis was confirmed by arterial angiography.

title:Relation of perfusion defects observed with myocardial contrast echocardiography to the severity of D_D023921: correlation with C_D013793-201 single-photon emission tomography.
abstract:It has been previously shown that myocardial contrast echocardiography is a valuable technique for delineating regions of myocardial underperfusion secondary to D_D054059 and to critical D_D023921 in the presence of D_D006940 stimulation. The aim of this study was to determine whether myocardial contrast echocardiography performed with a stable solution of sonicated albumin could detect regions of myocardial underperfusion resulting from various degrees of D_D023921. The perfusion defect produced in 16 open chest dogs was compared with the anatomic area at risk measured by the postmortem dual-perfusion technique and with C_D013793-201 single-photon emission tomography (SPECT). During a transient (20-s) D_D054059, a perfusion defect was observed with contrast echocardiography in 14 of the 15 dogs in which the occlusion was produced. The perfusion defect correlated significantly with the anatomic area at risk (r = 0.74; p less than 0.002). During C_D004176-induced D_D006940, 12 of the 16 dogs with a partial D_D023921 had a visible area of hypoperfusion by contrast echocardiography. The four dogs without a perfusion defect had a stenosis that resulted in a mild (0% to 50%) reduction in C_D004176-induced D_D006940. The size of the perfusion defect during stenosis correlated significantly with the anatomic area at risk (r = 0.61; p = 0.02). C_D013793-201 SPECT demonstrated a perfusion defect in all 14 dogs analyzed during C_D004176-induced D_D006940; the size of the perfusion defect correlated with the anatomic area at risk (r = 0.58; p less than 0.03) and with the perfusion defect by contrast echocardiography (r = 0.58; p less than 0.03). Thus, myocardial contrast echocardiography can be used to visualize and quantitate the amount of jeopardized myocardium during moderate to severe degrees of D_D023921. The results obtained show a correlation with the anatomic area at risk similar to that obtained with C_D013793-201 SPECT.

title:Potential deleterious effect of C_D005665 in radiocontrast D_D007674.
abstract:The purpose of the study was to determine the efficacy of C_D005665 in addition to intravenous fluids in the prevention of radiocontrast D_D007674. 18 patients, referred to a radiocontrast study, considered at risk because of preexisting D_D051437, were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, controlled trial, performed at the secondary care center of a 1,100-bed private university hospital. In addition to fluids, the treatment group received C_D005665 (mean dose 110 mg) intravenously 30 min prior to the injection of contrast material. The control group received fluids (mean 3 liters). Radiological studies were mostly angiographies performed with both ionic and non-ionic contrast material, at an average dose of 245 ml. D_D058186 in the group pretreated with C_D005665 (p < 0.005 by ANOVA), with a rise in serum C_D003404 from 145 +/- 13 to 182 +/- 16 mumol/l at 24 h, while no change occurred in the control group (from 141 +/- 6 to 142 +/- 7 mumol/l). D_D051437 was associated with D_D015431 in the C_D005665-treated group. C_D005665 may be deleterious in the prevention of radiocontrast D_D007674.

title:Etiologic factors in the pathogenesis of D_D008113 associated with C_D003276.
abstract:Within the last several years, previously rare D_D008113 have been seen in young women using C_D003276 C_D013256. The Registry for D_D008113 Associated with C_D003276 at the University of California, Irvine, has clearly identified 27 cases. The recent literature contains 44 case reports. Common to these 71 cases has been a histopathologic diagnosis of D_D020518, D_D000236, D_D006222, and D_D006528. Significant statistical etiologic factors include prolonged uninterrupted usage of C_D003276 C_D013256. Eight deaths and liver D_D012421 in 18 patients attest to the seriousness of this new potentially lethal adverse phenomenon.

title:D_D006086 prophylaxis with C_C107135 and C_D016559 is associated with a high incidence of D_D006504 and D_D014652: results of the EVTAC trial.
abstract:A calcineurin inhibitor combined with C_D008727 is the standard prophylaxis for D_D006086 (D_D006086) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). C_C107135, a derivative of C_D020123, seems to mediate antileukemia effects. We report on a combination of C_C107135 and C_D016559 in 24 patients (median age, 62 years) with either D_D009190 (D_D009190; n = 17) or D_D015470 (D_D015470; n = 7) undergoing intensive conditioning followed by HSCT from related (n = 4) or unrelated (n = 20) donors. All patients engrafted, and only 1 patient experienced grade IV D_D052016. Nine patients (37%) developed acute grade II-IV D_D006086, and 11 of 17 evaluable patients (64%) developed chronic extensive D_D006086. Transplantation-associated D_D014652 (D_D014652) occurred in 7 patients (29%), with 2 cases of D_D058186. The study was terminated prematurely because an additional 6 patients (25%) developed D_D006504 (D_D006504), which was fatal in 2 cases. With a median follow-up of 26 months, the 2-year overall survival rate was 47%. Although this new combination appears to be effective as a prophylactic regimen for acute D_D006086, the incidence of D_D014652 and D_D006504 is considerably higher than seen with other regimens.

title:Effect of some convulsants on the protective activity of C_C066440 and its combinations with C_D014635 or C_D002998 in amygdala-kindled rats.
abstract:C_C066440 (5 mg/kg) exerted a significant protective action in amygdala-kindled rats, reducing both D_D012640 and afterdischarge durations. The combinations of C_C066440 (2.5 mg/kg) with C_D014635, C_D002998, or C_D002220 (applied at their subprotective doses) also exhibited antiD_D012640 effect in this test. However, only two first combinations occurred to be of pharmacodynamic nature. Among several chemoconvulsants, C_D001640, C_D016202 and C_D001498 (the opener of L-type C_D002118 channels) reversed the protective activity of C_C066440 alone and its combination with C_D014635. On the other hand, C_D001640, C_D000628 and C_D001498 inhibited the anticonvulsive action of C_C066440 combined with C_D002998. The results support the hypothesis that the protective activity of C_C066440 and its combinations with other antiepileptics may involve potentiation of GABAergic neurotransmission and blockade of L-type of C_D002118 channels.

title:D_D017114 with concurrent C_D016642 and C_D002231 therapy.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: To report a case of fatal D_D017093 possibly associated with concurrent use of C_D016642 and C_D002231. CASE SUMMARY: A 41-year-old Chinese man with a history of D_D006980 had been treated with C_D002231 and C_D011433 for the past 5 years. He received a 10-day course of C_D016642 as an aid for smoking cessation 10 weeks prior to presentation. He developed acute D_D017093 with rapid deterioration of renal function. Liver biopsy showed evidence of nonspecific D_D056486. His condition was further complicated by D_D018805 and D_D001778. Death resulted 19 days after the onset of symptoms. The likelihood that C_D016642 induced D_D056486 in our patient was possible, based on the Naranjo probability scale. DISCUSSION: Although there is increasing evidence of D_D056486 induced by C_D016642, this is the first case of fatality that could have resulted from acute D_D017093 in a patient receiving C_D016642 while on concomitant treatment with C_D002231. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of D_D017114 induced by C_D016642 given concurrently with other D_D056486 drugs.

title:Long term hormone therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.
abstract:BACKGROUND: Hormone therapy (HT) is widely used for controlling menopausal symptoms and has also been used for the management and prevention of D_D002318, D_D010024 and D_D003704 in older women. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review first published in 2005. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of long-term HT on mortality, cardiovascular outcomes, D_D009369, D_D005705, cognition, D_D050723 and quality of life. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the following databases to November 2007: Trials Register of the Cochrane D_D008599 and Subfertility Group, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biological Abstracts. Also relevant non-indexed journals and conference abstracts. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised double-blind trials of HT versus placebo, taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women. HT included C_D004967, with or without C_D011374, via oral, transdermal, subcutaneous or transnasal routes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Nineteen trials involving 41,904 women were included. In relatively healthy women, combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of D_D054556 or coronary event (after one year's use), D_D020521 (after three years), breast D_D009369 and D_D005705. Long-term C_D004967-only HT significantly increased the risk of D_D054556, D_D020521 and D_D005705 (after one to two years, three years and seven years' use respectively), but did not significantly increase the risk of breast D_D009369. The only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of D_D050723 and (for combined HT) colon D_D009369, with long-term use. Among women aged over 65 who were relatively healthy (i.e. generally fit, without overt disease) and taking continuous combined HT, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of D_D003704. Among women with D_D002318, long-term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of D_D054556.One trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking C_D004967-only HT, versus similar-sized placebo groups. The only significantly increased risk reported was for D_D054556 in women taking combined continuous HT: their absolute risk remained low, at less than 1/500. However, this study was not powered to detect differences between groups of younger women. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease. We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control, though short-term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women.

title:Passage of C_D008353 into the brain around D_D005910: a potential cause of rebound phenomenon. A study on 21 patients.
abstract:AIM: Widespread use of C_D008353 to reduce D_D001929 and lower D_D019586 in D_D001932 patients continues to be afflicted by the so-called rebound phenomenon. Leakage of C_D008353 into the brain parenchyma through an altered BBB and secondary reversal of osmotic gradient is considered the major cause of rebound . This has only been demonstrated experimentally in animals. As a contribution to this issue we decided to research the possible passage of C_D008353 into the brain after administration to 21 D_D001932 patients. METHODS: C_D008353 (18% solution; 1 g/kg) was administered as a bolus to patients (ten had D_D005910, seven brain D_D009362 and four D_D008579) about 30 minutes before craniotomy. During resection, a sample of the surrounding D_D004487 white matter was taken at the same time as a 10 ml venous blood sample. C_D008353 concentrations were measured in plasma and white matter by a modified version of the enzyme assay of Blonquist et al. RESULTS: In most D_D005910 patients, C_D008353 concentrations in white matter were 2 to 6 times higher than in plasma (mean 3.5 times). In D_D008579 and D_D009362 patients plasma concentrations of C_D008353 were higher than white matter concentrations except in three cases with infiltration by neoplastic cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study show that even after a single bolus, C_D008353 may leak through the altered BBB near D_D005910, reversing the initial plasma-to-blood osmotic gradient, aggravating peritumoral D_D004487 and promoting rebound of ICP.

title:Can C_D008012 reduce C_D013390 induced D_D010149?
abstract:This study was undertaken to determine the effect of C_D008012 pretreatment on reduction of C_D013390-induced D_D063806 in patients undergoing general anesthesia for gynecological surgery. One hundred and thirty-five patients were assigned to one of three groups in a prospective, double blind, randomized manner. Group PS, the control group, received normal saline and C_D013390 1.5 mg x kg(-1); Group LS, C_D008012 1.5 mg x kg(-1) and C_D013390 1.5 mg x kg(-1); Group PR, normal saline and C_C061870 0.6 mg x kg(-1). C_D009020 0.1 mg x kg(-1) iv was given for premedication and all patients were monitored with a noninvasive blood pressure monitor, ECG and pulse oximetry. Anesthesia was induced with 5 mg.kg(-1) C_D013874 iv. followed by C_D013390 (Group PS, LS) or C_C061870 (Group PR) for tracheal intubation. Following administration of these agents, the presence, and degree of D_D005207 were assessed visually on a four point scale by one investigator who was blinded to the drug administered. The blood pressure and heart rate of each patient were monitored on nine occasions. Twenty-four hours later, any D_D063806 experienced was assessed according to a structured questionaire and graded by a four point scale by one investigator blinded to the intraoperative management. The results indicate that muscle D_D005207 was not found in Group PR while the patients in Group LS had a lower incidence of muscle D_D005207 than those in Group PS (p < 0.001). At 24 h, the incidence of D_D063806 was higher in Group PS than in Group LS and PR (p < 0.05). A correlation was not found between the incidence of D_D063806 and the occurrence of muscle D_D005207. The changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were not significant among the three groups. In conclusion, where C_D013390 is used, C_D008012 is proven to be the useful pretreatment agent for the reduction of D_D010149.

title:Open-label assessment of C_D064704 for the treatment of acute bacterial D_D012852 in adults.
abstract:PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of C_D064704 (500 mg orally once daily for 10 to 14 days) in treating adult outpatients with acute bacterial D_D012852. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 329 patients enrolled in the study at 24 centers. All patients had a pre-therapy Gram's stain and culture of sinus exudate obtained by antral puncture or nasal endoscopy. Clinical response was assessed on the basis of signs and symptoms and sinus radiograph or computed tomography results. Microbiologic cure rates were determined on the basis of presumed plus documented eradication of the pre-therapy pathogen(s). RESULTS: The most common pathogens were Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Of 300 clinically evaluable patients, 175 (58%) were cured and 90 (30%) were improved at the post-therapy evaluation, resulting in a clinical success rate of 88%. Thirty-five patients (12%) clinically failed treatment. The microbiologic eradication rate (presumed plus documented) among 138 microbiologically evaluable patients was 92%. Microbiologic eradication rates (presumed plus documented) of the most common pathogens ranged from 93% (M. catarrhalis) to 100% (S. pneumoniae) at the post-therapy visit. All but one of the 265 patients who were cured or improved at post-therapy returned for a long-term follow-up visit; 243 (92%) remained well 4 to 6 weeks after therapy; and 21 (8%) had a relapse of symptoms. Adverse events considered to be related to C_D064704 administration were reported by 29 patients (9%). The most common drug-related adverse events were D_D003967, D_D005414, and D_D009325; most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that C_D064704 500 mg once daily is an effective and safe treatment for acute bacterial D_D012852.

title:Clinical evaluation on combined administration of oral C_D011464 analogue C_C048081 and phosphodiesterase inhibitor C_C045645.
abstract:Among various oral antiplatelets, a combination of a novel C_D011464 analogue C_C048081 (C_C048081) and a potent phosphodiesterase inhibitor C_C045645 (C_C045645) may result in untoward clinical effects due to possible synergistic elevation of intracellular C_D000242 (C_D000242). Thereby, a clinical study of the combined administration of the two agents was attempted. Twelve healthy volunteers were assigned to take C_C048081/C_C045645 in the following schedule; C_C048081: 40 micrograms at day 1 and 120 micrograms t.i.d. from day 7 to 14, C_C045645: 200 mg t.i.d. from day 3 to 14. At various time intervals, physical examination and blood collection for ex vivo D_D001791 and determination of intraplatelet C_D000242 were performed. Throughout the observation period, no significant alteration in vital signs was observed. Seven out of 12 subjects experienced D_D006261 of a short duration accompanying D_D005483 in one and D_D009325 in one, especially after ingestion of C_C045645. All of these symptoms, probably caused by the vasodilating effect of the two agents, were of mild degree and no special treatment was required. Intraplatelet C_D000242 content was gradually but significantly increased to 9.84 +/- 4.59 pmol per 10(9) platelets at day 14 in comparison with the initial value (6.87 +/- 2.25 pmol). The platelet aggregability was significantly suppressed at various time intervals but no additive or synergistic inhibitory effect by the combined administration was noted. In conclusion, the combined administration of C_C048081/C_C045645 is safe at doses used in the study, though the beneficial clinical effect of the combined administration has yet to be elucidated.

title:Gastrointestinal tolerability of C_C422649 in D_D001172 patients: results of the C_C422649 vs C_D004008 gastrointestinal tolerability and effectiveness trial (EDGE-II).
abstract:OBJECTIVE: A randomised, double-blind study to compare the gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability, safety and efficacy of C_C422649 and C_D004008 in patients with D_D001172 (D_D001172). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 4086 patients (mean age 60.8 years) diagnosed with D_D001172 were enrolled and received C_C422649 90 mg daily (n = 2032) or C_D004008 75 mg twice daily (n = 2054). Use of gastroprotective agents and low-dose C_D001241 was allowed. The prespecified primary end point consisted of the cumulative rate of patient discontinuations due to clinical and laboratory GI adverse experiences (AEs). General safety was also assessed, including adjudicated D_D002318 event data. Efficacy was evaluated using the Patient Global Assessment of Disease Status (PGADS; 0-4 point scale). RESULTS: Mean (SD; maximum) duration of treatment was 19.3 (10.3; 32.9) and 19.1 (10.4; 33.1) months in the C_C422649 and C_D004008 groups, respectively. The cumulative discontinuation rate due to D_D005767 was significantly lower with C_C422649 than C_D004008 (5.2 vs 8.5 events per 100 patient-years, respectively; hazard ratio 0.62 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.81; p<or=0.001)). The incidence of discontinuations for D_D006973-related and D_D004487-related AEs were significantly higher with C_C422649 (2.5% and 1.1% respectively) compared with C_D004008 (1.5% and 0.4% respectively; p<0.001 for D_D006973 and p<0.01 for D_D004487). C_C422649 and C_D004008 treatment resulted in similar efficacy (PGADS mean changes from baseline -0.62 vs -0.58, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: C_C422649 90 mg demonstrated a significantly lower risk for discontinuing treatment due to D_D005767 compared with C_D004008 150 mg. Discontinuations from renovascular AEs, although less common than discontinuations from D_D005767, were significantly higher with C_C422649.

abstract:OBJECTIVES: To evaluate D_D001480 (D_D001480), including D_D017109, with C_C069541 in patients with D_D001714. METHODS: Data were analyzed from four similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, 3- to 12-week studies. Two studies evaluated C_C069541 monotherapy (up to 800 mg/day) (n = 209) versus placebo (n = 198), with C_D008094 or C_D006220 monotherapy as respective active controls. Two studies evaluated C_C069541 (up to 800 mg/day) in combination with a mood stabilizer (C_D008094 or C_D014635, C_C069541 + C_D008094/C_D014635) (n = 196) compared to placebo and mood stabilizer (PBO + C_D008094/C_D014635) (n = 203). D_D001480 were evaluated using the Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS), the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), adverse event reports and anticholinergic drug usage. RESULTS: The incidence of D_D001480-related adverse events, including D_D017109, was no different with C_C069541 monotherapy (12.9%) than with placebo (13.1%). Similarly, D_D001480-related adverse events with C_C069541 + C_D008094/C_D014635 (21.4%) were no different than with PBO + C_D008094/C_D014635 (19.2%). Adverse events related to D_D001480 occurred in 59.6% of patients treated with C_D006220 (n = 99) monotherapy, whereas 26.5% of patients treated with C_D008094 (n = 98) monotherapy experienced adverse events related to D_D001480. The incidence of D_D017109 was low and similar with C_C069541 monotherapy (3.3%) and placebo (6.1%), and with C_C069541 + C_D008094/C_D014635 (3.6%) and PBO + C_D008094/C_D014635 (4.9%). C_D008094thium was associated with a significantly higher incidence (p < 0.05) of D_D014202 (18.4%) than C_C069541 (5.6%); cerebellar D_D014202, which is a known adverse effect of C_D008094, may have contributed to the elevated rate of D_D014202 in patients receiving C_D008094 therapy. C_D006220 induced a significantly higher incidence (p < 0.001) of D_D017109 (33.3% versus 5.9%), D_D014202 (30.3% versus 7.8%), and D_D001480 (35.4% versus 5.9%) than C_C069541. No significant differences were observed between C_C069541 and placebo on SAS and BARS scores. Anticholinergic use was low and similar with C_C069541 or placebo. CONCLUSIONS: In D_D001714, the incidence of D_D001480, including D_D017109, with C_C069541 therapy is similar to that with placebo.

title:Contribution of the sympathetic nervous system to salt-sensitivity in lifetime C_D002216-treated spontaneously D_D006973 rats.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that, in lifetime C_D002216-treated spontaneously D_D006973 rats (SHR), the sympathetic nervous system contributes importantly to the D_D006973 effect of C_D017673 supplementation. METHODS: Male SHR (aged 6 weeks) that had been treated from conception onward with either C_D002216 or vehicle remained on a basal C_D012965 diet or were fed a high C_D012965 diet. After 2 weeks, the rats were subjected to ganglionic blockade and 2 days later, an infusion of C_D003000. RESULTS: Lifetime C_D002216 treatment significantly lowered mean arterial pressure in both groups. Intravenous infusion of the ganglionic blocker C_D018738 resulted in a rapid decline in MAP that eliminated the C_D017673-induced D_D006973 in both groups. Infusion of the central nervous system C_D058647 C_D003000 also resulted in a greater reduction in MAP in both groups of SHR that were fed the high (compared with the basal) C_D012965 diet. CONCLUSIONS: In both lifetime C_D002216-treated and control SHR, the sympathetic nervous system contributes to the pressor effects of a high C_D012965 diet.

title:Dose-related beneficial and adverse effects of dietary C_D003345 on C_D010755-induced delayed D_D009422 in chickens.
abstract:C_C025541 (C_C025541), 360 mg/kg, po, and C_D007531 (C_D007531), 1 mg/kg sc, were administered to adult White Leghorn chickens 24 hr after they were placed on diets containing 0 to 300 ppm C_D003345. Supplemented diets were continued until clinical signs and lesions of delayed D_D009422 appeared. Although low concentrations (less than or equal to 50 ppm) of C_D003345 had beneficial effects on C_C025541-induced D_D009422, greater than or equal to 200 ppm exacerbated clinical signs in chickens given either C_C025541 or C_D007531. D_D020258 esterase activities 24 hr after C_C025541 or C_D007531 were less than 20% of values measured in chickens not given C_D010755 compounds. Chickens given 200 ppm C_D003345 without C_C025541 or C_D007531 had significantly elevated activity of plasma cholinesterase and significantly inhibited activity of liver carboxylesterase. D_D009410 were also evident in distal levels of the peripheral nerves of chickens given C_C025541 or C_D007531.

title:In vivo characterization of a dual C_D058915 in animal models of D_D010300.
abstract:The in vivo characterization of a dual C_D058915 in several animal models of D_D010300 is described. Discovery and scale-up syntheses of compound 1 are described in detail, highlighting optimization steps that increased the overall yield of 1 from 10.0% to 30.5%. Compound 1 is a potent A(2A)/A(1) receptor antagonist in vitro (A(2A) K(i) = 4.1 nM; A(1) K(i) = 17.0 nM) that has excellent activity, after oral administration, across a number of animal models of D_D010300 including mouse and rat models of C_D006220-induced D_D002375, mouse model of C_D012110-induced D_D004409, rat C_D016627 (C_D016627) lesion model of drug-induced rotation, and C_D015632-treated non-human primate model.

title:An extremely rare case of D_D063726 in a D_D019698 patient during C_C417083 and C_D012254 treatment.
abstract:During treatment of D_D019698 patients with interferon and C_D012254, a lot of side effects are described. Twenty-three percent to 44% of patients develop D_D003866. A minority of patients evolve to D_D011605. To the best of our knowledge, no cases of D_D063726 occurring during interferon therapy have been described in the literature. We present a 49-year-old woman who developed a D_D063726 during treatment with C_C417083 weekly and C_D012254. She complained of seeing parasites and the larvae of fleas in her stools. This could not be confirmed by any technical examination. All the complaints disappeared after stopping C_C417083 and reappeared after restarting it. She had a complete sustained viral response.

title:Possible D_D009459 related to concomitant treatment with C_D017374 and C_D000525.
abstract:A 74-year-old man with D_D003866 was admitted to a D_D001523 hospital due to D_D007319, D_D001068, exhaustion, and D_D011595. Medical treatment was initiated at a daily dose of 20 mg C_D017374 and 1.2 mg C_D000525. On the 10th day of C_D017374 and C_D000525 treatment, the patient exhibited marked D_D011596, disorientation, and severe D_D009127 with D_D014202. The patient had a D_D005334 (38.2 degrees C), fluctuating blood pressure (between 165/90 and 130/70 mg mm Hg), and severe D_D001480. Laboratory tests showed an elevation of C_D003401 phosphokinase (2218 IU/L), C_D001224 aminotransferase (134 IU/L), C_D000409 aminotransferase (78 IU/L), and BUN (27.9 mg/ml) levels. The patient received C_D001971 and C_D003975 to treat his symptoms. 7 days later, the D_D005334 disappeared and the patient's serum CPK levels were normalized (175 IU/L). This patient presented with symptoms of D_D009459 (D_D009459), thus demonstrating that D_D009459-like symptoms can occur after combined C_D017374 and C_D000525 treatment. The adverse drug reaction score obtained by the Naranjo algorithm was 6 in our case, indicating a probable relationship between the patient's D_D009459-like adverse symptoms and the combined treatment used in this case. The involvement of physiologic and environmental aspects specific to this patient was suspected. Several risk factors for D_D009459 should be noted in elderly D_D003866 patients whose symptoms often include D_D003681, D_D011595, D_D044342, and exhaustion. Careful therapeutic intervention is necessary in cases involving elderly patients who suffer from D_D003866.

title:C_D010862 D_D012640 cause age-dependent D_D001308.
abstract:Children who have D_D013226 have continuous or rapidly repeating D_D012640 that may be life-threatening and may cause life-long changes in brain and behavior. The extent to which D_D013226 causes D_D001308 is unknown. A naturalistic auditory location discrimination method was used to evaluate this question using an animal model of D_D013226. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with saline on postnatal day (P) 20, or a convulsant dose of C_D010862 on P20 or P45. C_D010862 on either day induced D_D013226; D_D013226 at P45 resulted in CA3 cell loss and spontaneous D_D012640, whereas P20 rats had no cell loss or spontaneous D_D012640. Mature rats were trained with sound-source location and sound-silence discriminations. Control (saline P20) rats acquired both discriminations immediately. In D_D013226 (P20) rats, acquisition of the sound-source location discrimination was moderately impaired. D_D013226 (P45) rats failed to acquire either sound-source location or sound-silence discriminations. D_D013226 in rat causes an age-dependent, long-term D_D001308. This impairment may explain one cause of D_D001308 in humans.

title:Cardiovascular risk with C_D016861: general problem with substance specific differences?
abstract:Randomised clinical trials and observational studies have shown an increased risk of D_D009203, D_D020521, D_D006973 and D_D006333 during treatment with C_D016861. Adverse cardiovascular effects occurred mainly, but not exclusively, in patients with concomitant risk factors. C_D016861 cause complex changes in renal, vascular and cardiac prostanoid profiles thereby increasing vascular resistance and fluid retention. The incidence of cardiovascular adverse events tends to increase with the daily dose and total exposure time. A comparison of individual selective and unselective C_D016861 suggests substance-specific differences, which may depend on differences in pharmacokinetic parameters or inhibitory potency and may be contributed by C_D011453-independent effects. Diagnostic markers such as C_C109794 (C_C109794) or high-sensitive C-reactive protein might help in the early identification of patients at risk, thus avoiding the occurrence of serious D_D002318.

title:Predictors of D_D051437 in patients with D_D006333 during C_D000809-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy: results from the studies of D_D018487 (SOLVD)
abstract:BACKGROUND: Although C_D000809-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy reduces mortality rates in patients with congestive D_D006333 (D_D006333), it may also cause D_D051437. Little information is available to predict which patients are at highest risk for this complication. OBJECTIVE: To quantify specific clinical predictors of D_D051437 in patients with D_D006333 who are prescribed C_D000809-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. METHOD: We analyzed data from the Studies of D_D018487 (SOLVD), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of C_D004656 for the treatment of D_D006333. There were 3379 patients randomly assigned to C_D004656 with a median follow-up of 974 days and 3379 patients randomly assigned to placebo with a mean follow-up of 967 days. D_D051437 was defined as a rise in serum C_D003404 >/=0.5 mg/dL (44 micromol/L) from baseline. We used time-to-event analysis to identify potential predictors of decrease in renal function including age, baseline ejection fraction, baseline C_D003404, low systolic blood pressure (<100 mm Hg), history of D_D006973, D_D003920, and use of antiplatelet, C_D004232, and beta-blocker therapy. RESULTS: Patients randomly assigned to C_D004656 had a 33% greater likelihood of D_D051437 than controls (P =.003). By multivariate analysis, in both the placebo and C_D004656 groups older age, C_D004232 therapy, and D_D003920 were associated with D_D051437, whereas beta-blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective. Older age was associated with a greater risk of developing D_D051437 in both groups, but significantly more so in the C_D004656 group (C_D004656: risk ratio [RR] 1.42 per 10 years, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32-1.52 with C_D004656; placebo: RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.12-1.25). C_D004232 therapy was likewise associated with a greater risk of D_D051437 in the C_D004656 group (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.70-2.08) than in the placebo group (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.09-1.66). Conversely, C_D004656 had a relative renoprotective effect (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.13-1.53) compared with placebo (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.57-2.44) in patients with D_D003920. A lower risk of D_D051437 was seen in both groups with beta-blocker therapy (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57-0.85) and higher baseline ejection fraction (RR 0.93 per 5% increment, 95% CI 0.91-0. 96). CONCLUSIONS: C_D004656 use caused a 33% increase in the risk of D_D051437 in patients with D_D006333. C_D004232 use and advanced age increased this risk. D_D003920 was associated with an increased risk of D_D051437 in all patients with D_D006333, but this risk was reduced in the C_D004656 group compared with the placebo group. beta-Blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective in all patients regardless of therapy.

title:C_D010389 induced acute D_D002819|D001264: case report and review of the literature.
abstract:BACKGROUND: C_D010389 is an C_C064210 derivative that is structurally different from C_D000662 and used in the treatment of D_D001289. C_D010389 has not been commonly associated in the literature as a cause of acute D_D009069. The following case describes two children acutely poisoned with C_D010389 who experienced profound D_D002819|D001264. CASE REPORT: Two, 3-year-old male, identical twin siblings presented to the emergency department after found playing with a an empty bottle of C_D010389 originally containing 59 tablets. The children had a medical history significant for D_D001289 previously treated with C_D008774 without success. This was their first day of C_D010389 therapy. The D_D002819|D001264 movements began 45 min to 1 h after ingestion. The children gave no history of prior D_D009069 and there was no family history of D_D009069. The children received gastrointestinal decontamination and high doses of intravenous C_D001569 in an attempt to control the D_D002819|D001264 movements. Despite treatment, the children continued to have D_D002819|D001264 for approximately 24 hours. Forty-eight hours after admission, the children appeared to be at their baseline and were discharged home. CONCLUSION: C_D010389 associated D_D009069 has been rarely reported in the acute toxicology literature. The possibility of D_D002819|D001264 movements should be considered in patients presenting after C_D010389 D_D062787.

title:Continuous subcutaneous administration of C_D015080 to prevent C_D007069-induced hemorrhagic cystitis.
abstract:Hemorrhagic cystitis is a major potential D_D064420 of C_D007069 that can be prevented by administering C_D015080 along with the cytotoxic agent. C_D015080 is generally administered by the intravenous route, although experience with oral delivery of the drug has increased. The continuous subcutaneous administration of C_D015080 has the advantage of not requiring intravenous access. In addition, subcutaneous delivery of the neutralizing agent will not be associated with the risk of inadequate urinary C_D015080 concentrations, such as in a patient taking oral C_D015080 who experiences severe C_D007069-induced D_D014839 and is unable to absorb the drug. Limited clinical experience with continuous subcutaneous C_D015080 administration suggests it is a safe, practical, and economic method of drug delivery that permits C_D007069 to be administered successfully in the outpatient setting.

title:Modification of drug action by D_D022124.
abstract:Pretreatment with C_C018824 (C_C018824) (6 mmol/kg s.c.) approximately doubled the time C_D009020-treated mice remained on a hot surface and similarly increased muscular D_D001259 by C_D003975, but C_C018824 treatment alone had no effect. Thus, D_D022124 is capable of altering drug action and must be considered along with impaired drug metabolism in enhanced drug responses associated with D_D008107. Experiments in vitro showed that C_D000109-induced C_D002395 release from bovine adrenal medulla is depressed as much as 50% by 0.3 mM C_C018824 and C_D011189-induced contractions of guinea-pig ileum were inhibited 20% by 5 mM C_C018824. Addition of excess C_D002118 reversed the D_D003866 in both tissues, but C_D002118-independent C_D002395 release by C_D000079 was not blocked by C_C018824. These results suggested that C_D000641 blocks C_D002118 channels. Parallels in the actions of C_C018824 and the C_D002118 channel blocker C_D014700 support this concept. Both C_D014700 (10 mg/kg i.p.) and C_C018824 pretreatment enhanced C_D009020 D_D000699- and C_D003975-induced muscular D_D001259 and antagonized C_D000661-induced motor activity, and neither C_D014700 nor C_C018824 affected the convulsant action of C_D010433. The data suggest that D_D022124 exerts a C_D002118 channel blocking action which enhances the effects of central nervous system depressants and certain opioid analgesics.

title:Risk of D_D007674 after consumption of nonionic C_D003287 by children undergoing cardiac angiography: a prospective study.
abstract:Despite increasing reports on nonionic C_D003287-induced D_D007674 (D_D007674) in hospitalized adult patients during cardiac procedures, the studies in pediatrics are limited, with even less focus on possible predisposing factors and preventive measures for patients undergoing cardiac angiography. This prospective study determined the incidence of D_D007674 for two nonionic C_D003287 (C_D003287), C_C038192 and C_D007472, among 80 patients younger than 18 years and compared the rates for this complication in relation to the type and dosage of C_D003287 and the presence of D_D003490. The 80 patients in the study consecutively received either C_C038192 (group A, n = 40) or C_D007472 (group B, n = 40). Serum C_D012964 (C_D012964), C_D011188 (C_D011188), and C_D003404 (C_D003404) were measured 24 h before angiography as baseline values, then measured again at 12-, 24-, and 48-h intervals after C_D003287 use. Urine samples for C_D012964 and C_D003404 also were checked at the same intervals. Risk of D_D051437, D_D058186, D_D051437, D_D051437, and End-stage D_D007674 (RIFLE criteria) were used to define D_D007674 and its incidence in the study population. Accordingly, among the 15 D_D007674 patients (18.75%), 7.5% of the patients in group A had increased risk and 3.75% had D_D058186, whereas 5% of group B had increased risk and 2.5% had D_D058186. Whereas 33.3% of the patients with D_D007674 were among those who received the proper dosage of C_D003287, the percentage increased to 66.6% among those who received larger doses, with a significant difference in the incidence of D_D007674 related to the different dosages of C_D003287 (p = 0.014). Among the 15 patients with D_D007674, 6 had cyanotic D_D006331, but the incidence did not differ significantly from that for the noncyanotic patients (p = 0.243). Although clinically silent, D_D007674 is not rare in pediatrics. The incidence depends on dosage but not on the type of consumed nonionic C_D003287, nor on the presence of D_D003490, and although D_D007674 usually is reversible, more concern is needed for the prevention of such a complication in children.

title:A case of D_D017180 related to C_D002110 pretreatment.
abstract:Suboptimal D_D012640 duration is commonly encountered in electroconvulsive therapy practice, especially in older patients with higher D_D012640 thresholds. Intravenous C_D002110 is commonly used to improve D_D012640 duration and quality in such patients and is generally well tolerated aside from occasional reports of relatively benign D_D018879. We describe a patient with no previous history of D_D006331 or D_D001145 who developed sustained bigeminy and 2 brief runs of D_D017180 after C_D002110 administration. Although intravenous C_D002110 is generally well tolerated, the clinician should be aware of the potential for unpredictable and serious ventricular D_D001145s.

title:Optical coherence tomography can measure axonal loss in patients with C_D004977-induced D_D009901.
abstract:PURPOSE: To map and identify the pattern, in vivo, of D_D009410 in C_D004977-induced D_D009901 using optical coherence tomography (OCT). C_D004977 is an antimycobacterial agent often used to treat D_D014376. A serious complication of C_D004977 is an D_D009901 that impairs visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and color vision. However, early on, when the toxic D_D009901 is mild and partly reversible, the funduscopic findings are often subtle and easy to miss. METHODS: Three subjects with a history of C_D004977 (C_D004977)-induced D_D009901 of short-, intermediate-, and long-term D_D014786 were administered a full neuro-ophthalmologic examination including visual acuity, color vision, contrast sensitivity, and fundus examination. In addition, OCT (OCT 3000, Humphrey-Zeiss, Dublin, CA) was performed on both eyes of each subject using the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) analysis protocol. OCT interpolates data from 100 points around the optic nerve to effectively map out the RNFL. RESULTS: The results were compared to the calculated average RNFL of normal eyes accumulated from four prior studies using OCT, n=661. In all subjects with history of C_D004977-induced D_D009901, there was a mean loss of 72% nerve fiber layer thickness in the temporal quadrant (patient A, with eventual recovery of visual acuity and fields, 58% loss; patient B, with intermediate D_D014786, 68% loss; patient C, with chronic D_D014786, 90% loss), with an average mean optic nerve thickness of 26+/-16 microm. There was a combined mean loss of 46% of fibers from the superior, inferior, and nasal quadrants in the (six) eyes of all three subjects (mean average thickness of 55+/-29 microm). In both sets (four) of eyes of the subjects with persistent D_D014786 (patients B and C), there was an average loss of 79% of nerve fiber thickness in the temporal quadrant. CONCLUSIONS: The OCT results in these patients with C_D004977-induced D_D009901 show considerable loss especially of the temporal fibers. This is consistent with prior histopathological studies that show predominant loss of parvo-cellular axons (or small-caliber axons) within the papillo-macular bundle in toxic or hereditary D_D009901. OCT can be a valuable tool in the quantitative analysis of D_D009901. Additionally, in terms of management of C_D004977-induced D_D009901, it is important to properly manage C_D004977 dosing in patients with D_D051437 and to achieve proper transition to a maintenance dose once an appropriate loading dose has been reached.

title:Effects of the cyclooxygenase-2 specific inhibitor C_C406224 versus nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and placebo on cardiovascular D_D013927 events in patients with D_D001168.
abstract:There have been concerns that the risk of cardiovascular D_D013927 events may be higher with cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-specific inhibitors than nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We evaluated cardiovascular event data for C_C406224, a new COX-2-specific inhibitor in approximately 8000 patients with osteoD_D001168 and rheumatoid D_D001168 treated with this agent in randomized clinical trials. The incidence of cardiovascular D_D013927 events (cardiac, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular, or arterial D_D013927) was determined by analyzing pooled C_C406224 (10-80 mg daily), nonselective NSAID (C_D004008 75 mg bid, C_D007052 800 mg tid, or C_D009288 500 mg bid) and placebo data from 10 randomized osteoD_D001168 and rheumatoid D_D001168 trials that were 6-52 weeks in duration. The incidence rates of events were determined in all patients (n = 7934) and in users of low-dose (< or =325 mg daily) C_D001241 (n = 1051) and nonusers of C_D001241 (n = 6883). Crude and exposure-adjusted incidences of D_D013927 events were similar for C_C406224, NSAIDs, and placebo. The risk of serious D_D013927 events was also similar for each C_C406224 dose. D_D013927 risk was consistently higher for users of C_D001241 users than nonusers of C_D001241 (placebo, 1.4% vs. 0%; C_C406224, 1.7% vs. 0.2%; NSAIDs, 1.9% vs. 0.5%). The rates of events in users of C_D001241 were similar for all 3 treatment groups and across C_C406224 doses. Short- and intermediate-term treatment with therapeutic (10 or 20 mg daily) and supratherapeutic (40 or 80 mg daily) C_C406224 doses was not associated with an increased incidence of D_D013927 events relative to nonselective NSAIDs or placebo in osteoD_D001168 and rheumatoid D_D001168 patients in controlled clinical trials.

title:A randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study of C_D004809 for SSRI-induced female D_D020018.
abstract:The objective of this study was to determine whether C_D004809, an alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonist previously shown to enhance genital blood flow in women, has beneficial effects in reversing antidepressant-induced D_D020018. Nineteen D_D020018 women receiving either C_D005473, C_D020280, or C_D017374 participated in an eight-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of the effects of C_D004809 (50 mg) on self-report measures of sexual desire, arousal, orgasm, and sexual satisfaction. Although there were significant improvements relative to baseline in sexual desire and orgasm intensity/pleasure on 50 mg C_D004809 1-hr prior to sexual activity, significant improvements in these measures, as well as in sexual arousal and orgasmic ability also were noted with placebo. These findings highlight the importance of conducting placebo-controlled trials for this condition.

title:D_D007172 occurs following substantia nigra lesions in the rat.
abstract:Erectile function was assessed 6 weeks following uni- and bilateral injections of C_D016627 in the substantia nigra nucleus of the brain. Behavioral C_D001058-induced penile erections were reduced (5/8) and increased (3/8) in uni- and bilateral lesioned animals. Intracavernous pressures, following electrical stimulation of the cavernous nerve, decreased in lesioned animals. Lesions of the substantia nigra were confirmed by histology. Concentration of C_D004298 and its metabolites were decreased in the striatum of substantia nigra lesioned rats. Lesions of the substantia nigra are therefore associated with D_D007172 in rats and may serve as a model to study D_D007172 in D_D010300.

title:Potential therapeutic use of the selective C_D004298 D1 receptor agonist, C_C095427: an acute study in D_D020734 C_D007980-primed monkeys.
abstract:The clinical utility of C_D004298 (C_D004298) D1 receptor agonists in the treatment of D_D010300 (D_D010300) is still unclear. The therapeutic use of selective C_D004298 D1 receptor agonists such as C_C071262 (C_C071262) and C_C079415 (C_C079415) seems limited because of their duration of action, which is too short for C_C071262 (< 1 hr) and too long for C_C079415 (> 20 hr, leading to behavioral tolerance). We therefore conducted the present acute dose-response study in four C_D015632 (C_D015632)-exposed cynomolgus monkeys primed to exhibit C_D007980-induced D_D004409 to evaluate the locomotor and D_D004409 effects on challenge with four doses (from 0.03 to 1.0 mg/kg) of C_C095427 (C_C095427), a selective and full C_D004298 D1-like receptor agonist with an intermediate duration of action. C_D007980 and the C_D004298 D2-like receptor agonist, C_C416545 (C_C416545) were also used for comparison. Acute administration of C_C095427 was as efficacious in alleviating C_D015632-induced D_D020734 as C_D007980 and C_C416545, but was less likely to reproduce the C_D007980-induced D_D004409 in these animals than with either C_C416545 or subsequent challenge of C_D007980. Selective stimulation of the C_D004298 D1 receptor may provide better integration of neural inputs transmitted to the internal segment of the globus pallidus (referred to as the basal ganglia output) compared with C_D007980 and selective C_D004298 D2 receptor agonist. Potent C_D004298 D1 receptor agents with an intermediate duration of efficacy such as C_C095427 (approximately 4 hr at higher doses tested) are potential therapeutic tools in D_D010300 and merit further attention.

title:Deaths from local anesthetic-induced D_D012640 in mice.
abstract:Median convulsant (CD50) and median lethal (LD50) doses of three representative local anesthetics were determined in adult mice to evaluate the threat to life of local anesthetic-induced D_D012640. The CD50 and LD50, respectively, were 57.7 and 58.7 mg/kg for C_D002045, 111.0 and 133.1 mg/kg for C_D008012, and 243.4 and 266.5 mg/kg for C_C004616. When given intraperitoneally, C_D002045 thus was only about twice as toxic as C_D008012 and four times as toxic as C_C004616. D_D012640 always preceded death, except after precipitous D_D006323 from extreme doses. A CD50 dose of local anesthetic (causing D_D012640 in 50% of mice) was fatal in 90% of C_D002045-induced D_D012640, in 57% of the C_C004616 group, and in 6% of the C_D008012 group. The narrow gap between convulsant and lethal doses of local anesthetics indicates that untreated D_D012640 present much more of a threat to life than heretofore appreciated.

title:Myoclonic, atonic, and absence D_D012640 following institution of C_D002220 therapy in children.
abstract:Five children, aged 3 to 11 years, treated with C_D002220 for D_D004827, had an acute aberrant reaction characterized by the onset of myoclonic, atypical absence and/or atonic (minor motor) D_D012640 within a few days. When the C_D002220 was discontinued, two of the children returned to their former state very quickly, two had the minor motor D_D012640 resolve in 3 and 6 months, and one had the D_D012640 persist. The child in whom the D_D012640 persisted was later found to have D_D009472. The other children are doing well on other anticonvulsants.

abstract:The hemodynamic effects of C_D002216 and other C_D000806 may be mediated by the endogenous opioid system. The opioid antagonist C_D009270 has been shown to block or reverse the D_D007022 actions of C_D002216. We report a case of an intentional C_D002216 D_D062787, manifested by marked D_D007022, that resolved promptly with the administration of C_D009270. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of C_D002216-induced D_D007022 treated with C_D009270. Our experience demonstrates a possible role of C_D009270 in the reversal of D_D007022 resulting from C_D002216.

title:C_D002220-induced D_D006331. Characterization of two distinct clinical syndromes.
abstract:A patient with sinus D_D001919 and D_D054537, induced by C_D002220, prompted an extensive literature review of all previously reported cases. From the analysis of these cases, two distinct forms of C_D002220-associated D_D006331 emerged. One patient group developed D_D013616 in the setting of a massive C_D002220 D_D062787. The second group consisted almost exclusively of elderly women who developed potentially life-threatening D_D001919 or D_D054537, associated with either therapeutic or modestly elevated C_D002220 serum levels. Because C_D002220 is widely used in the treatment of many neurologic and D_D001523 conditions, the recognition of the latter syndrome has important implications for the use of this drug in elderly patients.

title:Glutamatergic neurotransmission mediated by C_D016202 receptors in the inferior colliculus can modulate C_D006220-induced D_D002375.
abstract:The inferior colliculus (IC) is primarily involved in the processing of auditory information, but it is distinguished from other auditory nuclei in the brainstem by its connections with structures of the motor system. Functional evidence relating the IC to motor behavior derives from experiments showing that activation of the IC by electrical stimulation or excitatory C_D000596 microinjection causes freezing, escape-like behavior, and immobility. However, the nature of this immobility is still unclear. The present study examined the influence of excitatory C_D000596-mediated mechanisms in the IC on the D_D002375 induced by the C_D004298 receptor blocker C_D006220 administered systemically (1 or 0.5 mg/kg) in rats. C_D006220-induced D_D002375 was challenged with prior intracollicular microinjections of C_D018698 C_D016202 receptor antagonists, C_D016291 (15 or 30 mmol/0.5 microl) and C_C031231 (10 or 20 nmol/0.5 microl), or of the C_D016202 receptor agonist C_D016202 (C_D016202, 20 or 30 nmol/0.5 microl). The results showed that intracollicular microinjection of C_D016291 and C_C031231 previous to systemic injections of C_D006220 significantly attenuated the D_D002375, as indicated by a reduced latency to step down from a horizontal bar. Accordingly, intracollicular microinjection of C_D016202 increased the latency to step down the bar. These findings suggest that C_D018698-mediated mechanisms in the neural circuits at the IC level influence C_D006220-induced D_D002375 and participate in the regulation of motor activity.

title:Metabotropic C_D018698 7 receptor subtype modulates motor symptoms in rodent models of D_D010300.
abstract:Metabotropic C_D018698 (mGlu) receptors modulate synaptic transmission in the central nervous system and represent promising therapeutic targets for symptomatic treatment of D_D010300 (D_D010300). Among the eight mGlu receptor subtypes, mGlu7 receptor is prominently expressed in the basal ganglia, but its role in restoring motor function in animal models of D_D010300 is not known. The effects of C_C507346 (C_C507346), the first selective allosteric activator of mGlu7 receptors, were thus tested in different rodent models of D_D010300. Here, we show that oral (5 mg/kg) or intrastriatal administration (0.1 and 0.5 nmol) of C_C507346 reverses C_D006220-induced D_D002375 in rats. C_C507346 (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) reduces C_D001058-induced rotations in unilateral C_D016627 (C_D016627)-lesioned rats. In a more complex task commonly used to evaluate major D_D018476 symptoms of D_D010300 patients, 5 mg/kg C_C507346 reverses the increased reaction time to respond to a cue of bilateral C_D016627-lesioned rats. In addition, C_C507346 reduces the duration of C_D006220-induced D_D002375 in a mGlu7 receptor-dependent manner in wild-type but not mGlu7 receptor knockout mice. Higher doses of C_C507346 (10 and 20 mg/kg p.o.) have no effect on the same models of D_D010300. Overall these findings suggest that mGlu7 receptor activation can reverse motor dysfunction associated with reduced C_D004298 activity. Selective ligands of mGlu7 receptor subtypes may thus be considered as promising compounds for the development of antiparkinsonian therapeutic strategies.

title:C_D009553 prevents D_D008569 caused by C_D005996-induced D_D007022 in adult mice.
abstract:BACKGROUND: D_D007022 and a resultant decrease in cerebral blood flow have been implicated in the development of D_D003072. We tested the hypothesis that C_D009553 (C_D009553) administered at the onset of C_D005996 (C_D005996)-induced D_D007022 would preserve long-term associative memory. METHODS: The passive avoidance (PA) paradigm was used to assess memory retention. For PA training, latencies (seconds) were recorded for entry from a suspended platform into a Plexiglas tube where a shock was automatically delivered. Latencies were recorded 48 h later for a testing trial. Ninety-six Swiss-Webster mice (30-35 g, 6-8 wk), were randomized into 6 groups 1) saline (control), 2) C_D005996 immediately after learning, 3) C_D005996 3 h after learning, 4) C_D005996 and C_D009553, 5) vehicle, and 6) C_D009553 alone. The extent of D_D007022 and changes in brain tissue oxygenation (PbtO(2)) and in cerebral blood flow were studied in a separate group of animals. RESULTS: All groups exhibited similar training latencies (17.0 +/- 4.6 s). Mice subjected to D_D007022 episodes showed a significant decrease in latency time (178 +/- 156 s) compared with those injected with saline, C_D005996 + C_D009553, or delayed C_D005996 (580 +/- 81 s, 557 +/- 67 s, and 493 +/- 146 s, respectively). A Kruskal-Wallis 1-way analysis of variance indicated a significant difference among the 4 treatment groups (H = 15.34; P < 0.001). In a separate group of mice not subjected to behavioral studies, the same dose of C_D005996 (n = 3) and C_D005996 + C_D009553 (n = 3) caused mean arterial blood pressure to decrease from 85.9 +/- 3.8 mm Hg sem to 31.6 +/- 0.8 mm Hg sem and from 86.2 +/- 3.7 mm Hg sem to 32.6 +/- 0.2 mm Hg sem, respectively. Mean arterial blood pressure in mice treated with C_D009553 alone decreased from 88.1 +/- 3.8 mm Hg to 80.0 +/- 2.9 mm Hg. The intergroup difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). PbtO(2) decreased from 51.7 +/- 4.5 mm Hg sem to 33.8 +/- 5.2 mm Hg sem in the C_D005996 group and from 38.6 +/- 6.1 mm Hg sem to 25.4 +/- 2.0 mm Hg sem in the C_D005996 + C_D009553 groups, respectively. There were no significant differences among groups. CONCLUSION: In a PA retention paradigm, the injection of C_D005996 immediately after learning produced a significant impairment of long-term associative memory in mice, whereas delayed induced D_D007022 had no effect. C_D009553 attenuated the disruption in consolidation of long-term memory caused by C_D005996 but did not improve latency in the absence of D_D007022. The observed effect of C_D009553 may have been attributable to the preservation of C_D002118 homeostasis during D_D007022, because there were no differences in the PbtO(2) indices among groups.

abstract:We report a case of fatal internal D_D006470 in an elderly man who consumed only cranberry juice for two weeks while maintaining his usual dosage of C_D014859. We propose that naturally occurring compounds such as C_D005419, which are present in fruit juices, may increase the potency of C_D014859 by competing for the enzymes that normally inactivate C_D014859. While traditionally regarded as foodstuffs, consumption of fruit juices should be considered when patients develop adverse drug reactions.

title:C_D007545 induces primary loss of dystrophin in rat hearts: correlation with D_D009202.
abstract:The mechanism of C_D007545-induced D_D009202 is unknown, but a mismatch of C_D010100 supply vs. demand following coronary D_D007022 and D_D009202 is the best explanation for the complex morphological alterations observed. Severe alterations in the structural integrity of the sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes have been demonstrated to be caused by C_D007545. Taking into account that the sarcolemmal integrity is stabilized by the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) that connects actin and laminin in contractile machinery and extracellular matrix and by integrins, this study tests the hypothesis that C_D007545 affects sarcolemmal stability through changes in the DGC and integrins. We found different sensitivity of the DGC and integrin to C_D007545 subcutaneous administration. Immunofluorescent staining revealed that dystrophin is the most sensitive among the structures connecting the actin in the cardiomyocyte cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. The sarcomeric actin dissolution occurred after the reduction or loss of dystrophin. Subsequently, after lysis of myofilaments, gamma-sarcoglycan, beta-dystroglycan, beta1-integrin, and laminin alpha-2 expressions were reduced followed by their breakdown, as epiphenomena of the myocytolytic process. In conclusion, administration of C_D007545 to rats results in primary loss of dystrophin, the most sensitive among the structural proteins that form the DGC that connects the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton in cardiomyocyte. These changes, related to D_D007511, explain the severe alterations in the structural integrity of the sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes and hence severe and irreversible injury induced by C_D007545.

title:High C_D004041 diet-fed D_D009765 rats are highly sensitive to C_D004317-induced D_D066126.
abstract:Often, chemotherapy by C_D004317 (C_D004317) is limited due to life threatening D_D066126 in patients during and posttherapy. Recently, we have shown that moderate diet restriction remarkably protects against C_D004317-induced D_D066126. This cardioprotection is accompanied by decreased cardiac oxidative stress and C_D014280 and increased cardiac C_D004041ty-acid oxidation, C_D000255 synthesis, and upregulated JAK/STAT3 pathway. In the current study, we investigated whether a physiological intervention by feeding 40% high C_D004041 diet (HFD), which induces D_D009765 in male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-275 g), sensitizes to C_D004317-induced D_D066126. A LD(10) dose (8 mg C_D004317/kg, ip) administered on day 43 of the HFD feeding regimen led to higher D_D066126, D_D006331, lipid peroxidation, and 80% mortality in the D_D009765 (D_D009765) rats in the absence of any significant renal or hepatic toxicity. C_D004317 toxicokinetics studies revealed no change in accumulation of C_D004317 and C_D004317ol (toxic metabolite) in the normal diet-fed (ND) and D_D009765 hearts. Mechanistic studies revealed that D_D009765 rats are sensitized due to: (1) higher oxyradical stress leading to upregulation of uncoupling proteins 2 and 3, (2) downregulation of cardiac peroxisome proliferators activated receptor-alpha, (3) decreased plasma adiponectin levels, (4) decreased cardiac C_D004041ty-acid oxidation (666.9+/-14.0 nmol/min/g heart in ND versus 400.2+/-11.8 nmol/min/g heart in D_D009765), (5) decreased mitochondrial C_D000249-alpha2 protein kinase, and (6) 86% drop in cardiac C_D000255 levels accompanied by decreased C_D000255/C_D000244 ratio after C_D004317 administration. Decreased cardiac erythropoietin and increased SOCS3 further downregulated the cardioprotective JAK/STAT3 pathway. In conclusion, HFD-induced D_D009765 rats are highly sensitized to C_D004317-induced D_D066126 by substantially downregulating cardiac mitochondrial C_D000255 generation, increasing oxidative stress and downregulating the JAK/STAT3 pathway.

title:Complete D_D054537 secondary to C_D008094 therapy.
abstract:D_D012804 has been reported most frequently among the adverse cardiovascular effects of C_D008094. In the present case, complete D_D054537 with D_D013575 developed secondary to C_D008094 therapy, necessitating permanent pacemaker implantation. Serum C_D008094 levels remained under or within the therapeutic range during the D_D013575. C_D008094 should be used with extreme caution, especially in patients with mild disturbance of AV conduction.

title:D_D009459 induced by C_C092292 on the second day of treatment.
abstract:D_D009459 (D_D009459) is the rarest and most serious of the neuroleptic-induced D_D009069. We describe a case of D_D009459 (D_D009459) associated with the use of C_C092292. Although conventional neuroleptics are more frequently associated with D_D009459, atypical antipsychotic drugs like C_C092292 may also be a cause. The patient is a 24-year-old male with a history of D_D012559 who developed signs and symptoms of D_D009459 after 2 days of treatment with an 80-mg/day dose of orally administrated C_C092292. This case is the earliest (second day of treatment) D_D009459 due to C_C092292 reported in the literature.

title:Role of C_C013592 on biochemical alterations and antioxidant status in C_D007545-induced D_D009203 in rats.
abstract:The current study dealt with the protective role of C_C013592, a C_D059808 from Mangifera indica Linn. (Anacardiaceae), on C_D007545 (C_D007545)-induced D_D009203 (D_D009203) in rats through its antioxidative mechanism. Subcutaneous injection of C_D007545 (200 mg/kg body weight in 1 ml saline) to rats for 2 consecutive days caused D_D009202 in rat heart, which was determined by the increased activity of serum C_D019344 dehydrogenase (LDH) and C_D003401 phosphokinase isoenzymes (CK-MB), increased C_D014527 level and reduced plasma C_D007501 binding capacity. The protective role of C_C013592 was analyzed by C_C009591 (C_C009591) test used for macroscopic enzyme mapping assay of the D_D017202. The heart tissue antioxidant enzymes such as C_D013481 dismutase, catalase, C_D005978 peroxidase, C_D005978 transferase and C_D005978 reductase activities, non-enzymic antioxidants such as cerruloplasmin, C_D001205, C_D014810 and C_D005978 levels were altered in D_D009203 rats. Upon pretreatment with C_C013592 (100 mg/kg body weight suspended in 2 ml of C_D004121) given intraperitoneally for 28 days to D_D009203 rats protected the above-mentioned parameters to fall from the normal levels. Activities of heart tissue enzymic antioxidants and serum non-enzymic antioxidants levels rose significantly upon C_C013592 administration as compared to C_D007545-induced D_D009203 rats. From the present study it is concluded that C_C013592 exerts a beneficial effect against C_D007545-induced D_D009203 due to its antioxidant potential, which regulated the tissues defense system against D_D006331.

title:C_C071741 pretreatment reduces D_D009207 after C_D005045.
abstract:STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to compare the effect of pretreatment with C_C071741 1 microg/kg and the effect of gender on the incidence of D_D009207 after anesthesia induction with C_D005045. DESIGN: This was a randomized, double-blind study. SETTING: The study was conducted at a university hospital. PATIENTS: Sixty patients were pretreated in a randomized double-blinded fashion with C_C071741 1 microg/kg or placebo. Two minutes after C_C071741 or placebo injection, C_D005045 0.3 mg/kg was given. MEASUREMENTS: D_D009207 was recorded with a scale of 0 to 3. The grade of sedation (none, mild, moderate, severe), D_D009325, D_D011537, and D_D001049 were recorded after injection of both drugs. MAIN RESULTS: The incidence of D_D009207 was significantly lower in the C_C071741 group (6.7%) than in the placebo group (70%) (P < 0.001). None of the patients experienced sedation, D_D001049, D_D009325, or D_D011537 after injection of both drugs. In the placebo group, male patients were associated with significantly increased incidence of D_D009207 after C_D005045 administration. CONCLUSION: Pretreatment with C_C071741 1 microg/kg reduced D_D009207 after C_D005045 induction without side effects such as sedation, D_D001049, D_D009325, or D_D011537. Men experience increased incidence of D_D009207 than women after C_D005045 administration.

title:C_C004742 activates C_D002794 acetyltransferase from MC-IXC cells and improves drug-induced D_D000647.
abstract:The C_D002794 acetyltransferase (ChAT) activator, which enhances C_D002794rgic transmission via an augmentation of the enzymatic production of acetylC_D002794 (C_D000109), is an important factor in the treatment of D_D000544 (D_D000544). Methanolic extracts from Pueraria thunbergiana exhibited an activation effect (46%) on ChAT in vitro. Via the sequential isolation of Pueraria thunbergiana, the active component was ultimately identified as C_C004742 (C_C004742). In order to investigate the effects of C_C004742 from Pueraria thunbergiana on C_D012601-induced impairments of learning and memory, we conducted a series of in vivo tests. Administration of C_C004742 (4.5 mg/kg body weight) to mice was shown significantly to reverse C_D012601-induced D_D000647, according to the results of a Y-maze test. Injections of C_D012601 into mice resulted in impaired performance on Y-maze tests (a 37% decreases in alternation behavior). By way of contrast, mice treated with C_C004742 prior to the C_D012601 injections were noticeably protected from this performance impairment (an approximately 12%-21% decrease in alternation behavior). These results indicate that C_C004742 might play a role in acetylC_D002794 biosynthesis as a ChAT activator, and that it also ameliorates C_D012601-induced D_D000647.

title:Possible C_D017963-associated D_D006606.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: To report a case of persistent D_D006606 associated by C_D017963 therapy. CASE SUMMARY: A 76-year-old man presented with persistent D_D006606 after beginning C_D017963 for the treatment of D_D010612. D_D006606 were persistent and exhausting. Discontinuation of C_D017963 and therapy with C_D001418 finally resolved D_D006606. No organic cause of D_D006606 was identified despite extensive investigation. DISCUSSION: Pharmacotherapeutic agents have been uncommonly associated with D_D006606. Corticosteroids (C_D003907 and C_D008775), C_D001569 (C_D008874) and general anaesthesia have been the specific agents mentioned most frequently in the literature as being associated with the development of D_D006606. Few cases of drug-induced D_D006606 have been reported related to C_D018942 antimicrobials. Using the Naranjo adverse effect reaction probability scale this event could be classified as possible (score 5 points), mostly because of the close temporal sequence, previous reports on this reaction with other C_D018942s and the absence of any alternative explanation for D_D006606. Our hypothesis is that a vagal mechanism mediated by C_D017963 could be the pathogenesis of D_D006606 in our patient. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of drug-induced D_D006606 is difficult and often achieved only by a process of elimination. However, C_D018942 antimicrobials have been reported to be associated with D_D006606 and vagal mechanism could explain the development of this side-effect.

title:C_D005996 induces attacks of D_D020326 in sufferers of D_D020325.
abstract:D_D020325 and D_D020326 have the same D_D010146 phase, thus indicating that D_D020325 and D_D020326 share a common pathway of nociception. In recent years, increasing evidence has suggested that the messenger molecule C_D009569 (C_D009569) is involved in D_D010146 mechanisms of D_D020326. In order to clarify whether the same is true for D_D020325, in the present study we examined the D_D006261 response to intravenous infusion of C_D005996 (C_D005996) (0.5 microg/kg/min for 20 min) in 12 sufferers of D_D020325. The specific aim was to elucidate whether an aura and/or an attack of D_D020326 could be induced. Fourteen healthy subjects served as controls. Aura symptoms were not elicited in any subject. D_D006261 was more severe in D_D008881 than in the controls during and immediately after C_D005996 infusion (p=0.037) as well as during the following 11 h (p = 0.008). In the controls, the C_D005996-induced D_D006261 gradually disappeared, whereas in D_D008881 peak D_D006261 intensity occurred at a mean time of 240 min post-infusion. At this time the induced D_D006261 in 6 of 12 D_D008881 fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for D_D020326 of the International D_D006261 Society. The results therefore suggest that C_D009569 is involved in the D_D010146 mechanisms of D_D020325. Since cortical spreading D_D003866 has been shown to liberate C_D009569 in animals, this finding may help our understanding of the coupling between cortical spreading D_D003866 and D_D006261 in D_D020325.

title:D_D020521 and C_D003042 or C_D000661 use.
abstract:The association of C_D003042 and C_D000661 use with hemorrhagic and D_D007511 D_D020521 is based almost solely on data from case series. The limited number of epidemiologic studies of D_D020521 and use of C_D003042 and/or C_D000661 have been done in settings that serve mostly the poor and/or minorities. This case-control study was conducted in the defined population comprising members of Kaiser Permanente of Northern and Southern California. We attempted to identify all incident D_D020521s in women ages 15-44 years during a 3-year period using hospital admission and discharge records, emergency department logs, and payment requests for out-of-plan hospitalizations. We selected controls, matched on age and facility of usual care, at random from healthy members of the health plan. We obtained information in face-to-face interviews. There were 347 confirmed D_D020521 cases and 1,021 controls. The univariate matched odds ratio for D_D020521 in women who admitted to using C_D003042 and/or C_D000661 was 8.5 (95% confidence interval = 3.6-20.0). After further adjustment for potential confounders, the odds ratio in women who reported using C_D003042 and/or C_D000661 was 7.0 (95% confidence interval = 2.8-17.9). The use of C_D003042 and/or C_D000661 is a strong risk factor for D_D020521 in this socioeconomically heterogeneous, insured urban population.

title:Prevention of D_D001943 with C_D013629: preliminary findings from the Italian randomised trial among hysterectomised women. Italian C_D013629 Prevention Study.
abstract:BACKGROUND: C_D013629 is a candidate chemopreventive agent in D_D001943, although the drug may be associated with the development of D_D016889. Therefore we did a trial in hysterectomised women of C_D013629 as a chemopreventive. METHODS: In October, 1992, we started a double-blind placebo-controlled, randomised trial of C_D013629 in women (mainly in Italy) who did not have D_D001943 and who had had a hysterectomy. Women were randomised to receive C_D013629 20 mg per day or placebo, both orally for 5 years. The original plan was to follow the intervention phase by 5 years' follow-up. In June, 1997, the trialists and the data-monitoring committee decided to end recruitment primarily because of the number of women dropping out of the study. Recruitment ended on July 11, 1997, and the study will continue as planned. The primary endpoints are the occurrence of and deaths from D_D001943. This preliminary interim analysis is based on intention-to-treat. FINDINGS: 5408 women were randomised; participating women have a median follow-up of 46 months for major endpoints. 41 cases of D_D001943 occurred so far; there have been no deaths from D_D001943. There is no difference in D_D001943 frequency between the placebo (22 cases) and C_D013629 (19) arms. There is a statistically significant reduction of D_D001943 among women receiving C_D013629 who also used hormone-replacement therapy during the trial: among 390 women on such therapy and allocated to placebo, we found eight cases of D_D001943 compared with one case among 362 women allocated to C_D013629. Compared with the placebo group, there was a significantly increased risk of D_D014652 and D_D015228 among women on C_D013629. INTERPRETATION: Although this preliminary analysis has low power, in this cohort of women at low-to-normal risk of D_D001943, the postulated protective effects of C_D013629 are not yet apparent. Women using hormone-replacement therapy appear to have benefited from use of C_D013629. There were no deaths from D_D001943 recorded in women in the study. It is essential to continue follow-up to quantify the long-term risks and benefits of C_D013629 therapy.

title:Comparison of the effectiveness of C_D011899 and C_D002927 in inhibiting acid secretion in patients with gastric hypersecretory states.
abstract:The H2-C_D006632 receptor antagonists C_D011899 and C_D002927 were compared for their abilities to control gastric acid hypersecretion on a short- and long-term basis in 22 patients with gastric acid hypersecretory states. Nineteen patients had D_D015043, one patient had D_D034721, and two patients had idiopathic hypersecretion. The rates of onset of the action of C_D002927 and C_D011899 were the same. The actions of both drugs were increased by anticholinergic agents, and there was a close correlation between the daily maintenance dose of each drug needed to control acid secretion. However, C_D011899 was threefold more potent than C_D002927 both in acute inhibition studies and in the median maintenance dose needed (1.2 g per day for C_D011899 and 3.6 g per day for C_D002927). Sixty percent of the males developed breast changes or D_D007172 while taking C_D002927 and in all cases these changes disappeared when C_D002927 was replaced by C_D011899. Treatment with high doses of C_D002927 (one to 60 months; median, 11 months) or C_D011899 (two to 31 months; median, 14 months) was not associated with hepatic or hematologic toxicity or alterations of serum gastrin concentrations, but C_D011899 therapy was associated with a significantly lower serum C_D003404 level than seen with C_D002927 therapy. The results show that both drugs can adequately inhibit acid secretion in patients with gastric hypersecretory states. Both are safe at high doses, but C_D011899 is threefold more potent and does not cause the antiandrogen side effects frequently seen with high doses of C_D002927.

title:A catch in the D_D012202.
abstract:Twenty-six cases of D_D012202 syndrome from The Children's Hospital, Camperdown, Australia, occurring between 1973 and 1982 were reviewed. Of these, 20 cases met the US Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control criteria for the diagnosis of D_D012202 syndrome. C_D001241 or C_D012459 ingestion had occurred in only one of the 20 cases (5%), and C_D000082 (C_D000082) had been administered in only six of the cases (30%). Pathologic confirmation of the diagnosis of D_D012202 syndrome was accomplished in 90% of the cases. The incidence of D_D012202 syndrome in New South Wales, Australia, is estimated from this study to be approximately nine cases per 1 million children compared with recent US data of ten to 20 cases per 1 million children and three to seven cases per 1 million children in Great Britain. The mortality for these D_D012202 syndrome cases in Australia was 45% as compared with a 32% case-fatality rate in the United States. In Australia, the pediatric usage of C_D001241 has been extremely low for the past 25 years (less than 1% of total dosage units sold), with C_D000082 (C_D000082) dominating the pediatric analgesic and antipyretic market. D_D012202 syndrome may be disappearing from Australia despite a total lack of association with C_D012459s or C_D001241 ingestion, since there were no cases found at The Children's Hospital in 1983, 1984, or 1985.

abstract:The time course and concentration-effect relationship of C_D013726-induced D_D007008 was studied, using computer-aided pharmacokinetic-dynamic modeling. Subsequently we investigated the efficacy of C_D010096 in antagonizing such D_D007008, together with the pharmacokinetic interaction between both drugs. Six healthy subjects were given a 0.5 mg subcutaneous dose of C_D013726 on two occasions: 1 hour after oral administration of a placebo and 1 hour after 80 mg C_D010096 orally. In the 7-hour period after C_D013726 administration, plasma samples were taken for determination of plasma C_D011188 levels and drug concentrations. The sigmoid Emax model offered a good description of the relation between C_D013726 concentrations and C_D011188 effects. C_D010096 caused decreases of 65% and 56% of C_D013726 volume of distribution and clearance, respectively, and an increase of 130% of its AUC. In spite of higher C_D013726 concentrations after C_D010096 pretreatment, the D_D007008 was almost completely antagonized by the beta 2-blocking action.

abstract:Previous experiments in this laboratory have shown that microinjection of C_D008750 onto the ventrolateral cells of the B3 C_D012701 neurons in the medulla elicits a D_D007022 response mediated by a projection descending into the spinal cord. The present experiments were designed to investigate the role of the midline cells of the B3 C_D012701 neurons in the medulla, coinciding with the raphe magnus. In spontaneously D_D006973, D_D020521-prone rats, microinjection of C_D008750 into the area of the midline B3 C_D012701 cell group in the ventral medulla caused a potent D_D007022 of 30-40 mm Hg, which was maximal 2-3 h after administration and was abolished by the C_D012701 neurotoxin C_D015116 (C_D015116) injected intracerebroventricularly. However, intraspinal injection of C_D015116 to produce a more selective lesion of only descending C_D012701 projections in the spinal cord did not affect this D_D007022. Further, C_D015116 lesion of C_D012701 nerves travelling in the median forebrain bundle, one of the main ascending pathways from the B3 C_D012701 cells, did not affect the fall in blood pressure associated with a midline B3 C_D012701 C_D008750 injection. It is concluded therefore that, unlike the ventrolateral B3 cells which mediate a C_D008750-induced D_D007022 via descending projections, the midline C_D012701 B3 cells in the medulla contribute to the D_D007022 action of C_D008750, either by way of an ascending projection which does not pass through the median forebrain bundle, or through a projection restricted to the caudal brainstem.

title:C_D015016 treatment of D_D020018 induced by C_D012701 reuptake blockers.
abstract:BACKGROUND: Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that C_D015016 facilitates sexual behavior and may be helpful in the treatment of D_D007172. A single case report suggests that C_D015016 may be used to treat the D_D020018 of C_D002997. This study evaluated C_D015016 as a treatment for the D_D020018 caused by C_D012701 reuptake blockers. METHOD: Six patients with either D_D009771, D_D014256, D_D001008, or D_D019964 who suffered D_D020018 after treatment with C_D012701 reuptake blockers were given C_D015016 on a p.r.n. basis in an open clinical trial. Various doses of C_D015016 were used to determine the ideal dose for each patient. RESULTS: Five of the six patients experienced improved sexual functioning after taking C_D015016. One patient who failed to comply with C_D015016 treatment had no therapeutic effects. Side effects of C_D015016 included excessive sweating, increased D_D001008, and a wound-up feeling in some patients. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that C_D015016 may be an effective treatment for the D_D020018 caused by C_D012701 reuptake blockers. Future controlled studies are needed to further investigate the effectiveness and safety of C_D015016 for this indication.

title:D_D004342 immune reaction as a mechanism for C_D007741-associated D_D056486.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: To assess lymphocyte reactivity to C_D007741 and to serum containing putative ex vivo C_D007741 antigens or metabolites in a case of C_D007741-induced D_D056486. PATIENT: A 58-year-old woman with a clinical diagnosis of C_D007741-induced D_D056486. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from the patient were cultured in the presence of a solution of C_D007741 and also with sera collected from a volunteer before and after C_D007741 intake. A similar protocol was performed with lymphocytes from a healthy subject. RESULTS: No lymphocyte proliferation was observed either in the patient or in the healthy volunteer in the presence of C_D007741 solutions. A significant proliferative response to serum collected after C_D007741 intake was observed in the case of the patient compared with the proliferative response to the serum collected before the drug intake. No reactivity was found when lymphocytes from the healthy subject were tested under similar conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The methodology used allowed the detection of lymphocyte sensitization to sera containing ex vivo-prepared C_D007741 antigens, suggesting the involvement of an immunologic mechanism in C_D007741-induced D_D056486.

title:Reversible D_D006332 induced by C_D016559 in a pediatric heart transplant recipient: case report.
abstract:C_D016559 is a potent immunosuppressant that is frequently used in organ transplantation. However, adverse effects include D_D066126. Herein we describe transient D_D006332 induced by C_D016559 after heart transplantation. The D_D006984 caused no clinical symptoms but was noted because of elevation of plasma brain natriuretic peptide concentration and confirmed at echocardiography. Initially, allograft rejection was feared; however, myocardial biopsy samples revealed only interstitial D_D004487 and mild D_D006332; neither cellular nor humoral rejection was detected. The blood C_D016559 concentration was higher than usual at that time; thus, C_D016559 dosage was reduced. Myocardial D_D006984 completely resolved upon reducing the target concentration of C_D016559 and did not recur, as confirmed at echocardiography and myocardial biopsy. Thus, we conclude that C_D016559 induces reversible D_D006332. In patients receiving C_D016559 therapy, blood concentration should be carefully controlled and extreme attention paid to cardiac involvement.

title:Comparison of unilateral pallidotomy and subthalamotomy findings in advanced D_D010300.
abstract:A prospective, randomized, double-blind pilot study to compare the results of stereotactic unilateral pallidotomy and subthalamotomy in advanced D_D010300 (D_D010300) refractory to medical treatment was designed. Ten consecutive patients (mean age, 58.4 +/- 6.8 years; 7 men, 3 women) with similar characteristics at the duration of disease (mean disease time, 8.4 +/- 3.5 years), disabling motor fluctuations (Hoehn _ Yahr stage 3-5 in off-drug phases) and C_D007980-induced D_D004409 were selected. All patients had bilateral symptoms and their C_D007980 equivalent dosing were analysed. Six patients were operated on in the globus pallidus interna (GPi) and four in the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Clinical evaluation included the use of the Unified D_D010300 Rating Scale (UD_D010300RS), Hoehn_Yahr score and Schwab England activities of daily living (ADL) score in 'on'- and 'off'-drug conditions before surgery and 6 months after surgery. There was statistically significant improvement in all contralateral major D_D010300 motor signs in all patients followed for 6 months. C_D007980 equivalent daily intake was significantly reduced in the STN group. Changes in UD_D010300RS, Hoehn _ Yahr and Schwab England ADL scores were similar in both groups. Cognitive functions were unchanged in both groups. Complications were observed in two patients: one had a left D_D006423 after pallidotomy and another one developed left hemiballistic movements 3 days after subthalamotomy which partly improved within 1 month with C_D014635 1000 mg/day. The findings of this study suggest that lesions of the unilateral STN and GPi are equally effective treatment for patients with advanced D_D010300 refractory to medical treatment.

title:Protective effects of antithrombin on C_D011692 D_D009401 in rats.
abstract:We investigated the effects of antithrombin, a plasma inhibitor of coagulation factors, in rats with C_D011692-induced D_D009401, which is an experimental model of human D_D009404. Antithrombin (50 or 500 IU/kg/i.v.) was administered to rats once a day for 10 days immediately after the injection of C_D011692 (50 mg/kg/i.v.). Treatment with antithrombin attenuated the C_D011692-induced D_D006402. C_D011692-induced D_D007674 and D_D006949 were also suppressed. Histopathological examination revealed severe D_D007674 such as proteinaceous casts in tubuli and tubular expansion in the kidney of control rats, while an improvement of the damage was seen in antithrombin-treated rats. In addition, antithrombin treatment markedly suppressed C_D011692-induced apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells. Furthermore, C_D011692-induced increases in renal cytokine content were also decreased. These findings suggest that thrombin plays an important role in the pathogenesis of C_D011692-induced D_D009404. Treatment with antithrombin may be clinically effective in patients with D_D009404.

title:Reverse or inverted D_D054549 (reverse D_D054549) in a young woman in the setting of C_D000661 use.
abstract:Transient D_D054549 was first described in Japan as "D_D054549." This syndrome has been identified in many other countries. Many variations of this syndrome have been recently described in the literature. One of the rarest is the reverse type of this syndrome, with hyperdynamic apex and complete D_D004409 of the base (as opposed to the classic D_D054549). In this article, we report an interesting case of a young woman who presented with this rare type of reverse D_D054549 syndrome occurring after C_D000661 use. This report is followed by review of the literature.

title:Attenuated disruption of prepulse inhibition by C_D004298rgic stimulation after maternal deprivation and adolescent C_D003345 treatment in rats.
abstract:The development of D_D012559 may include an early neurodevelopmental stress component which increases vulnerability to later stressful life events, in combination leading to overt disease. We investigated the effect of an early stress, in the form of maternal deprivation, combined with a later stress, simulated by chronic periadolescent C_D003345 treatment, on behaviour in rats. Acute treatment with C_D001058 caused disruption of prepulse inhibition (PPI) in controls and in rats that had undergone either maternal deprivation or C_D003345 treatment, but was surprisingly absent in rats that had undergone the combined early and late stress. C_D000661 treatment significantly disrupted PPI in both non-deprived groups, but was absent in both maternally deprived groups. The C_D012701-1A receptor agonist, C_D017371, induced a significant disruption of PPI in all groups. C_D000661-induced D_D006948 was similar in all groups. These results show an inhibitory interaction of early stress, caused by maternal deprivation, combined with 'adolescent' stress, simulated by C_D003345 treatment, on C_D004298rgic regulation of PPI. The altered effects of C_D001058 and C_D000661 could indicate differential changes in C_D004298 receptor signalling leading to functional desensitisation, or altered modulation of sensory gating in the nucleus accumbens by limbic structures such as the hippocampus.

title:Peripheral C_D007505 induced D_D009410 in rat substantia nigra.
abstract:C_D007501 accumulation is considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of D_D010300. To demonstrate the relationship between peripheral C_D007501 overload and C_D004298rgic neuron loss in rat substantia nigra (SN), in the present study we used fast cyclic voltammetry, C_D014443 hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry, Perls' C_D007501 staining, and high performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection to study the D_D009410 and increased C_D007501 content in the SN of C_D007505 overloaded animals. The findings showed that peripheral C_D007505 overload increased the C_D007501 staining positive cells and reduced the number of TH-immunoreactive neurons in the SN. As a result, C_D004298 release and content, as well as its metabolites contents were decreased in caudate putamen. Even more dramatic changes were found in chronic overload group. These results suggest that peripheral C_D007505 can increase the C_D007501 level in the SN, where excessive C_D007501 causes the D_D009410. The chronic C_D007501 overload may be more destructive to C_D004298rgic neurons than the acute C_D007501 overload.

abstract:Skin reactions associated with oral C_C030123-derived anticoagulants are an uncommon occurrence. D_C535509 (D_C535509) is primarily a D_C565222, though systemic involvement may be encountered. We report 4 patients with late-onset D_C535509 probably due to C_D014859. All 4 patients presented with D_D012871 that developed after receiving C_D014859 for several years. The results of D_D012871 biopsies were available in 3 patients, confirming D_C535509 Cutaneous lesions resolved in all patients after C_D014859 was discontinued. In 2 of the 4 patients, rechallenge with C_D014859 led to recurrence of the lesions. D_C535509 may be a late-onset adverse reaction associated with C_D014859 therapy.

title:The activation of spinal C_D016202 receptors may contribute to degeneration of spinal motor neurons induced by neuraxial C_D009020 after a noninjurious interval of D_D020760.
abstract:We investigated the relationship between the degeneration of spinal motor neurons and activation of C_D016202 (C_D016202) receptors after neuraxial C_D009020 following a noninjurious interval of D_D001157 in rats. D_D020760 was induced by D_D001157 for 6 min with a balloon catheter. In a microdialysis study, 10 muL of saline (group C; n = 8) or 30 mug of C_D009020 (group M; n = 8) was injected intrathecally (IT) 0.5 h after reflow, and 30 mug of C_D009020 (group SM; n = 8) or 10 muL of saline (group SC; n = 8) was injected IT 0.5 h after sham operation. Microdialysis samples were collected preischemia, before IT injection, and at 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h of reperfusion (after IT injection). Second, we investigated the effect of IT C_D016291 (30 mug) on the histopathologic changes in the spinal cord after C_D009020-induced D_D020336. After IT C_D009020, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) C_D018698 concentration was increased in group M relative to both baseline and group C (P < 0.05). This increase persisted for 8 hrs. IT C_D016291 significantly reduced the number of dark-stained alpha-motoneurons after C_D009020-induced D_D020336 compared with the saline group. These data indicate that IT C_D009020 induces D_D020336 with a concomitant increase in CSF C_D018698, which is involved in C_D016202 receptor activation. We suggest that opioids may be D_D020258 in the setting of D_D020760 via C_D016202 receptor activation.

title:Reduced C_D012964 channel density, altered voltage dependence of inactivation, and increased susceptibility to D_D012640 in mice lacking C_D012964 channel beta 2-subunits.
abstract:C_D012964 channel beta-subunits modulate channel gating, assembly, and cell surface expression in heterologous cell systems. We generated beta2(-/-) mice to investigate the role of beta2 in control of C_D012964 channel density, localization, and function in neurons in vivo. Measurements of [(3)H]C_D012530 (C_D012530) binding showed a significant reduction in the level of plasma membrane C_D012964 channels in beta2(-/-) neurons. The loss of beta2 resulted in negative shifts in the voltage dependence of inactivation as well as significant decreases in C_D012964 current density in acutely dissociated hippocampal neurons. The integral of the compound action potential in optic nerve was significantly reduced, and the threshold for action potential generation was increased, indicating a reduction in the level of functional plasma membrane C_D012964 channels. In contrast, the conduction velocity, the number and size of axons in the optic nerve, and the specific localization of C_D012964(v)1.6 channels in the nodes of Ranvier were unchanged. beta2(-/-) mice displayed increased susceptibility to D_D012640, as indicated by reduced latency and threshold for C_D010862-induced D_D012640, but seemed normal in other neurological tests. Our observations show that beta2-subunits play an important role in the regulation of C_D012964 channel density and function in neurons in vivo and are required for normal action potential generation and control of excitability.

title:Screening for stimulant use in adult emergency department D_D012640 patients.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of positive plasma drug screening for C_D003042 or C_D000661 in adult emergency department D_D012640 patients. METHODS: This prospective study evaluated consecutive eligible D_D012640 patients who had a plasma sample collected as part of their clinical evaluation. Plasma was tested for C_D000661 and the C_D003042 metabolite C_C005618 using enzyme-mediated immunoassay methodology. Plasma samples with C_C005618 greater than 150 ng/mL or an C_D000661 greater than 500 ng/mL were defined as positive. Patient demographics, history of underlying drug or C_D000431-related D_D012640 disorder, estimated time from D_D012640 to sample collection, history or suspicion of C_D003042 or C_D000661 abuse, results of clinical urine testing for drugs of abuse, and assay results were recorded without patient identifiers. RESULTS: Fourteen of 248 (5.6%, 95% CI 2.7%-8.5%) plasma samples were positive by immunoassay testing for C_C005618 and no samples (0%, 95% CI 0-1.2%) were positive for C_D000661. Positive test results were more common in patient visits where there was a history or suspicion of C_D003042 or C_D000661 abuse (p < 0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: During this study period, routine plasma screening for C_D003042 and C_D000661s in adult D_D012640 patients had a low yield. As a result, routine plasma screening would yield few cases of stimulant drug in which there was neither a history nor suspicion of D_D019966 in this population.

title:Evidence of functional somatotopy in GPi from results of pallidotomy.
abstract:The objective of this study was to explore the functional anatomy of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) by studying the effects of unilateral pallidotomy on D_D010300 'off' signs and C_D007980-induced D_D004409 (D_D004409). We found significant positive correlations between the preoperative C_D007980 responsiveness of motor signs and the C_D007980 responsiveness of scores in timed tests (Core Assessment Program for Intracerebral Transplantations) in the contralateral limbs and the improvement in these scores after surgery, whereas there was no correlation with the improvement in D_D004409. We also found a highly significant correlation (P: < 0.0001, r = 0.8) between the volume of the ventral lesion in the GPi and the improvement in D_D004409 in the contralateral limbs, whereas there was no correlation between the ventral volume and the improvement in D_D010300 'off' signs. The volumes of the total lesion cylinder and the dorsal lesion did not correlate with the outcome of either D_D004409 or D_D010300 'off' signs. The differential predictive value of C_D007980 responsiveness for the outcome of D_D010300 'off' signs and D_D004409 and the different correlations of ventral lesion volume with D_D004409 and D_D010300 'off' signs indicate that different anatomical or pathophysiological substrates may be responsible for the generation of D_D010300 'off' signs and D_D004409. Whereas cells in a wider area of the GPi may be implicated in D_D010300, the ventral GPi seems to be crucial for the manifestation of D_D004409. We suggest that our observations are additional proof of the functional somatotopy of the systems within the GPi that mediate D_D010300 and D_D004409, especially along the dorsoventral trajectory used in pallidotomy. The outcome of pallidotomy in which the lesion involves the ventral and dorsal GPi could be the net effect of alteration in the activity of pathways which mediate different symptoms, and hence could be variable.

title:D_D010146 responses in C_D008691-maintained opioid abusers.
abstract:Providing D_D010146 management for known opioid abusers is a challenging clinical task, in part because little is known about their D_D010146 experience and analgesic requirements. This study was designed to describe D_D010146 tolerance and analgesic response in a sample of D_D009293 stabilized in C_D008691-maintenance (MM) treatment (n = 60) in comparison to matched nondependent control subjects (n = 60). By using a placebo-controlled, two-way factorial design, tolerance to cold-pressor (CP) D_D010146 was examined, both before and after oral administration of therapeutic doses of common opioid (C_D004091 2 mg) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (C_D020910 10 mg) analgesic agents. Results showed that MM individuals were significantly less tolerant of CP D_D010146 than control subjects, replicating previous work. Analgesic effects were significant neither for medication nor group. These data indicate that MM opioid abusers represent a D_D010146-intolerant subset of clinical patients. Their complaints of D_D010146 should be evaluated seriously and managed aggressively.

title:Urine N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase--a marker of tubular damage?
abstract:BACKGROUND: Although an indicator of D_D005198, an increased urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) activity might reflect increased lysosomal activity in renal tubular cells. METHODS: C_D011692 (C_D011692) was administered to Sprague Dawley rats to induce D_D011507. Total protein, albumin, NAG activity and protein electrophoretic pattern were assessed in daily urine samples for 33 days. The morphological appearance of the kidneys was examined on days three, four, six, eight and thirty three and the NAG isoenzyme patterns on days zero, four, eight and thirty three. RESULTS: Following intravenous C_D011692 urine volume and urine NAG activity increased significantly by day two, but returned to normal by day four. After day four all treated animals exhibited a marked rise in urine albumin, total protein excretion and NAG activity. Electrophoresis showed a generalised increase in middle and high molecular weight urine proteins from day four onwards. Protein droplets first appeared prominent in tubular cells on day four. Peak urine NAG activity and a change in NAG isoenzyme pattern coincided with both the peak D_D011507 and the reduction in intracellular protein and NAG droplets (day six onwards). CONCLUSIONS: This animal model demonstrates that an increase in lysosomal turnover and hence urine NAG activity, occurs when increased protein is presented to the tubular cells. Urine NAG activity is thus a measure of altered function in the renal tubules and not simply an indicator of damage.

title:Over expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptor during the development of C_D004967-induced rat D_D010911 may mediate C_D004967-initiated D_D009369 angiogenesis.
abstract:C_D004967, which have been associated with several types of human and animal D_D009369, can induce D_D009369 angiogenesis in the pituitary of Fischer 344 rats. The mechanistic details of D_D009369 angiogenesis induction, during C_D004967 D_D063646, are still unknown. To elucidate the role of C_D004967 in the regulation of D_D009369 angiogenesis in the pituitary of female rats, the density of blood vessels was analysed using factor VIII related antigen (FVIIIRAg) immunohistochemistry and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor (VEGF/VPF) was examined by Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis. The expression of VEGF receptor (VEGFR-2/Flk-1/KDR) was also examined by immunohistochemistry. The results demonstrated that C_D004958 (C_D004958) induces neovascularization, as well as the growth and enlargement of blood vessels after 7 days of exposure. The high D_D009369 angiogenic potential was associated with an elevated VEGF/VPF protein expression in the C_D004958 exposed pituitary of ovariectomized (OVEX) rats. VEGF/VPF and FVIIIRAg immunohistochemistry and endothelial specific lectin (UEA1) binding studies, indicate that the elevation of VEGF protein expression initially occurred in both blood vessels and non-endothelial cells. After 15 days of C_D004958 exposure, VEGF/VPF protein expression, in the non-endothelial cell population, sharply declined and was restricted to the blood vessels. The function of non-endothelial-derived VEGF is not clear. Furthermore, immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that VEGFR-2 (flk-1/KDR), expression was elevated significantly in the endothelial cells of microblood vessels after 7 days of C_D004958 exposure. These findings suggest that over expression of VEGF and its receptor (VEGFR-2) may play an important role in the initial step of the regulation of C_D004967 induced D_D009369 angiogenesis in the rat pituitary.

title:C_D017035-associated D_D009135. Report of a case.
abstract:A case of acute inflammatory D_D009135 associated with the use of C_D017035, a new hydrophilic 3-hydroxy-3 methylglutaril coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, is reported. The patient, a 69-year-old man was affected by D_D003924 and D_D006973. He assumed C_D017035 (20 mg/day) because of D_D006937. He was admitted with acute D_D009135 of the lower limbs which resolved in a few days after C_D017035 discontinuation. A previously unknown D_D007037, probably due to chronic D_D013967, was evidenced. Muscle biopsy (left gastrocnemius) revealed a perimysial and endomysial inflammatory infiltrate with a prevalence of CD4+ lymphocytes. While C_D008148 and C_D019821 have been associated with toxic D_D009135, C_D017035-associated D_D009135 could represent a distinct, inflammatory entity.

title:Dose-effect and structure-function relationships in C_D004317 D_D009202.
abstract:The D_D009202 (D_D009202) produced by the anticancer drug C_D004317 (C_D004317) (C_D004317) provides a unique opportunity to analyze dose-effect and structure-function relationships during development of D_D009202. We measured the degree of morphologic damage by ultrastructural examination of endomyocardial biopsy and the degree of performance abnormally by right heart catheterization in patients receiving C_D004317. Morphologic damage was variable but was proportional to the total cumulative C_D004317 dose between 100 and 600 mg/m2. Performance abnormalities correlated weakly with dose, exhibited a curvilinear relationship, and had a "threshold" for expression. Catheterization abnormalities correlated well with morphologic damage (r = 0.57 to 0.78) in a subgroup of patients in whom exercise hemodynamics were measured, and this relationship also exhibited a curvilinear, threshold configuration. In C_D004317-D_D009202 D_D009202 is proportional to the degree of cytotoxic insult (C_D004317 dose) while myocardial function is preserved until a critical dose or degree of damage is reached, after which myocardial performance deteriorates rapidly.

abstract:A 73-year-old woman died of D_D000741 less than two months after undergoing D_D002386 extraction and beginning topical therapy with C_D002701. The first signs of D_D010198 began within one month of the surgery. The pattern of the D_D000741 was associated with an idiosyncratic response to C_D002701. This was the second report of fatal D_D000741 after topical treatment with C_D002701 for ocular conditions, although two cases of reversible D_D001855 have also been reported. Any other suspected cases of D_D005128 associated with topically applied C_D002701 should be reported to the National Registry of Drug-Induced Ocular Side Effects, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR 97201.

abstract:A chronic D_D012559 patient was treated with an anticholinergic drug, C_D014282. The patient developed, paradoxically, sinus D_D001919. The reaction was specific to C_D014282 and not to other anticholinergic drugs. This antidyskinetic drug is widely used in clinical D_D001523 practice and physicians should be aware of this side effect.

title:Experimental C_D016572 D_D007674: risk of concomitant chemotherapy.
abstract:The role of C_D016572 (C_D016572) alone or in combination with various chemotherapeutics in the development of D_D007674 was evaluated in rats. Administration of 20 mg/kg/day C_D016572 for 4 weeks caused renal functional and structural changes similar to those reported in man. The combined administration of C_D016572 and various chemotherapeutic drugs with a D_D007674 potential, such as C_D005839 (at therapeutic doses), C_D000666 and C_D007654, which are frequently used in immunosuppressed patients, did not aggravate the C_D016572 induced D_D064420 in the rat model. C_D005839 at toxic doses, however, increased C_D016572 D_D007674. Thus, the D_D007674 induced by C_D016572 has a different pathogenetic mechanism.

title:Receptor mechanisms of C_D009538-induced D_D006948 in chronic C_D009538-treated rats.
abstract:Rats were pretreated with saline or C_D009538 (1.5 mg/kg per day) by subcutaneously implanting each animal with an Alzet osmotic mini-pump which continuously released saline or C_D009538 for 1, 5 and 14 days. At the end of each pretreatment period, animals were used for (i) determining their locomotor response to acutely injected C_D009538 (0.2 mg/kg, s.c.) and (ii) measuring the density of L-[3H]C_D009538 and [3H]C_D013134 binding sites in the striatum. We observed no changes in C_D009538-induced locomotor response, striatal L-[3H]C_D009538 and [3H]C_D013134 binding in the animals pretreated with C_D009538 for 1 day. In rats which were pretreated with C_D009538 for 5 days, there was a significant increase in the C_D009538-stimulated locomotor response which was associated with an increase in the number of L-[3H]C_D009538 binding sites and also with an elevated C_D004298 (C_D004298) level in the striatum. The number of striatal [3H]C_D013134 binding sites was not affected. In animals pretreated with C_D009538 for 14 days, the C_D009538-induced locomotor response remained to be potentiated. However, this response was correlated with an elevated number of striatal [3H]C_D013134 binding sites, whereas the number of striatal L-[3H]C_D009538 binding sites and the striatal C_D004298 level were normal. These results suggest that chronic C_D009538-treated rats develop D_D006948 in response to C_D009538 initially due to increases of both the density of nicotinic receptors and C_D004298 concentration, followed by inducing C_D004298 receptor supersensitivity in the striatum.

title:C_D006854-induced D_D006973 in humans: pressor responsiveness and sympathetic function.
abstract:Oral C_D006854 increases blood pressure and enhances pressor responsiveness in normal human subjects. We studied the effects of 1 week of oral C_D006854 (200 mg/day) on blood pressure, cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, forearm vascular resistance, and C_D009638 spillover to plasma in eight healthy male volunteers. Although diastolic blood pressure remained unchanged, systolic blood pressure increased from 119 to 135 mm Hg (SED +/- 3.4, p less than 0.01), associated with an D_D016534 (5.85-7.73 l/min, SED +/- 0.46, p less than 0.01). Total peripheral vascular resistance fell from 15.1 to 12.2 mm Hg/l/min (SED +/- 1.03, p less than 0.05). Resting forearm vascular resistance remained unchanged, but the reflex response to the cold pressor test was accentuated, the rise in resistance increasing from 10.5 mm Hg/ml/100 ml/min (R units) before treatment to 32.6 R units after treatment (SED +/- 6.4, p less than 0.025). The rise in forearm vascular resistance accompanying intra-arterial C_D009638 (25, 50, and 100 ng/min) was also significantly greater after C_D006854, increasing from an average of 14.9 +/- 2.4 R units before treatment to 35.1 +/- 5.5 R units after C_D006854 (SED +/- 6.0, p less than 0.05). A shift to the left in the dose-response relation and fall in threshold suggested increased sensitivity to C_D009638 after treatment. Measurement of resting C_D009638 spillover rate to plasma and C_D009638 uptake indicated that overall resting sympathetic nervous system activity was not increased. The D_D006973 with C_D006854 is associated with an D_D016534 (presumably due to increased blood volume).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

title:Effects of C_D013496 on the isolated perfused rat kidney.
abstract:Although C_D013496 has been associated with the development of D_D058186 in greater than 100 subjects, the mechanism of damage remains unclear. The direct D_D007674 effects of a single dose of 15 mg of C_D013496 were compared in the recirculating isolated rat kidney perfused with cell-free buffer with or without the addition of 5 mg/dL of C_D014527. There were no significant differences in renal C_D012964 excretion, C_D010100 consumption, or urinary flow rates in kidneys perfused with C_D013496 compared with the drug-free control groups. In contrast, a significant decline in glomerular filtration rate was found after the introduction of C_D013496 to the kidney perfused with C_D014527; no changes were found with C_D013496 in the absence of C_D014527. A significant decrease in the baseline excretion rate of C_D014527 was found in rats given C_D013496, compared with drug-free controls. However, the fractional excretion of C_D014527 was unchanged between the groups over the experimental period. In summary, C_D013496 causes D_D058186, most likely by directly altering the intrarenal distribution of C_D014527.

title:C_D003042-induced brainstem D_D012640 and behavior.
abstract:A variety of abnormal sensory/motor behaviors associated with electrical discharges recorded from the bilateral brainstem were induced in adult WKY rats by mechanical (electrode implants) and DC electrical current stimulations and by acute and chronic administration of C_D003042. The electrode implant implicated one side or the other of the reticular system of the brainstem but subjects were not incapacitated by the stimulations. C_D003042 (40 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously for an acute experiment and subsequent 20 mg/kg doses twice daily for 3 days in a chronic study. C_D003042 generated more abnormal behaviors in the brainstem perturbation group, especially the electrically perturbated subjects. The abnormal behaviors were yawning, retrocollis, D_D006948, D_D004342, "beating drum" behavior, squealing, head bobbing, circling, sniffing, abnormal posturing, and facial twitching. Shifts in the power frequency spectra of the discharge patterns were noted between quiet and pacing behavioral states. D_D004342 to various auditory, tactile, and visual stimulation was present and shifts in the brainstem ambient power spectral frequency occurred in response to tactile stimulation. These findings suggest that the brainstem generates and propagates pathological discharges that can be elicited by mechanical and DC electrical perturbation. C_D003042 was found to activate the discharge system and thus induce abnormal behaviors that are generated at the discharge site and at distant sites to which the discharge propagates. Cognitive functions may also be involved since dopaminergic and serotonergic cellular elements at the brainstem level are also implicated.

title:Increased sulfation and decreased 7alpha-hydroxylation of C_D003840 in C_D004997-induced D_D002779 in rats.
abstract:C_D003840 conjugation, transport capacity, and metabolism were compared in control and C_D004997-treated rats. Control rats were found to have a lower capacity to transport C_D003840 than tauroC_D003840, and both were decreased by C_D004997 treatment. During [24-14C]C_D003840 infusion, [14C]biliary C_D001647 secretion increased, but bile flow did not change significantly in either control or C_D004997-treated rats. C_D004997-treated animals excreted significantly less 14C as C_D013656 than did control animals, consistent with an impairment of 7alpha-hydroxylation of tauroC_D003840. C_D004997 treatment did not impair conjugation of C_D003840, but did result in an increase in sulfation of tauroC_D003840 from 1.5% in controls to nearly 4.0% (P less than 0.01). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the rat has a poorer tolerance for C_D003840 than do certain other species. Furthermore, the rat converts C_D003840, a poor choleretic, to C_D013656, a good choleretic. When this conversion is impaired with C_D004997 treatment, sulfation may be an important alternate pathway for excretion of this potentially harmful C_D001647.

title:Effects of C_D010042 on myocardial C_D010100 supply and demand in patients with chronic D_D003324. A hemodynamic, volumetric, and metabolic study in patients without D_D006333.
abstract:The effects of C_D004071 on myocardial C_D010100 supply and demand are of particular interest in the presence of obstructive D_D003324, but have not been measured previously in man. We assessed the effects of C_D010042 (0.015 mg/kg body weight) on hemodynamic, volumetric, and metabolic parameters in 11 patients with severe chronic D_D003324 without clinical congestive D_D006333. Because the protocol was long and involved interventions which might affect the determinations, we also studied in nine patients using an identical protocol except that C_D010042 administration was omitted. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic volume fell in each patient given C_D010042, even though they were initially elevated in only two patients. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure fell from 11.5+/-1.4 (mean+/-SE) to 5.6+/-0.9 mm Hg (P less than 0.001) and left ventricular end-diastolic volume fell from 100+/-17 to 82+/-12 ml/m2 (P less than 0.01) 1 h after C_D010042 infusion was completed. The maximum velocity of contractile element shortening increased from 1.68+/-0.11 ml/s to 2.18+/-0.21 muscle-lengths/s (P less than 0.05) and is consistent with an increase in contractility. No significant change in these parameters occurred in the control patients. No significant change in myocardial C_D010100 consumption occurred after C_D010042 administration but this may be related to a greater decrease in mean arterial pressure in the C_D010042 patients than in the control patients. We conclude that in patients with chronic D_D003324 who are not in clinical congestive D_D006333 D_D002303 after C_D010042 administration even when it is initially normal. Though this fall would be associated with a decrease in wall tension, and, therefore, of myocardial C_D010100 consumption, it may not be of sufficient magnitude to prevent a net increase in myocardial C_D010100 consumption. Nevertheless, compensatory mechanisms prevent a deterioration of resting myocardial metabolism.

title:D_D008133 related to C_D020117-C_D004110 interaction.
abstract:C_D020117, a cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) substrate, is widely prescribed for the treatment of D_D015835. D_D008133, D_D016171, and D_D016757 have been reported after concomitant administration with C_D004917 or C_D001393 antifungal agents, but not with other CYP3A4 inhibitors. A possible drug interaction occurred in a 45-year-old woman who was taking C_D020117 for D_D005764 and C_D004110, an agent that has inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, for D_D006973. The patient was in near D_D013575 and had D_D008133. After discontinuing C_D020117, the QT interval returned to normal and symptoms did not recur. We suggest that caution be taken when C_D020117 is prescribed with any potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, including C_D004110.

title:C_D017239 combined with C_D016190 in the first-line treatment of advanced D_D010051.
abstract:In a phase I study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of C_D017239 (C_D017239; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) given as a 3-hour infusion in combination with C_D016190 administered every 21 days to women with advanced D_D010051, C_D017239 doses were escalated as follows: level 1, 135 mg/m2; level 2, 160 mg/m2; level 3, 185 mg/m2; and level 4,210 mg/m2. The fixed dose of C_D016190 at levels 1 through 4 was given to achieve an area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 5 using the Calvert formula. In levels 5 and 6 the C_D016190 dose was targeted at AUCs of 6 and 7.5, respectively, combined with a fixed C_D017239 dose of 185 mg/m2. To date, 30 previously untreated patients, all with a good performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0 to 2) have been entered into this ongoing study. The dose-limiting D_D064420 of the combination was D_D001855 (D_D007970, D_D000380, and D_D013921). NeuroD_D064420 was largely moderate. So far, 14 patients are evaluable for response; of these, eight (57%) showed objective (complete or partial) response and disease stabilized in six patients. No patient had disease progression. We conclude that the combination of C_D017239 185 mg/m2 administered as a 3-hour infusion followed immediately by a 1-hour infusion of C_D016190 at an AUC of 6 can be administered safely in a 21-day schedule in the outpatient setting. The recommended dose for phase III studies is C_D017239 185 mg/m2 and C_D016190 AUC 6.

title:Treatment of C_D016559-related adverse effects by conversion to C_D016572 in liver transplant recipients.
abstract:When C_D016559 side effects persist despite dose reduction, conversion to C_D016572-based immunosuppression (CyA) is necessary. We characterized C_D016559 side effects that warranted discontinuation of the drug, and outcomes after conversion. Of 388 liver recipients who received C_D016559 as primary immunosuppression, 70 required conversion to CyA. We recorded indication for conversion, whether conversion was early or late after transplantation, C_D016559 dose and trough blood level at conversion, and incidence of rejection after conversion. Conversion was early in 29 patients (41.4%) and late in 41 (58.6%). Indications for early conversion were D_D020258 (20), D_D003922 (D_D003922) (5), D_D007674 (3), D_D005767 (6), and D_D009202 (1), and for late conversion were D_D020258 (15), D_D003922 (12), D_D007674 (3), D_D005767 (5), D_D056486 (6), D_D008232 (D_D008232) (2), D_D009202 (1), D_D000743 (1), and D_D011537 (1). All early-conversion patients showed improvement/resolution of symptoms. Among late-conversion patients, 37 (90.2%) had improvement/resolution; in 4 (9.8%), adverse effects persisted. The overall rejection rate was 30%. Sixty-two patients (88.6%) are alive with functioning grafts 686 +/- 362 days (range, 154-1433 days) after conversion. When C_D016559 side effects are unresponsive to dose reduction, conversion to CyA can be accomplished safely, with no increased risk of rejection and excellent long-term outcome.

title:Relative efficacy and D_D064420 of C_D009428 and C_D014031 in oncology patients.
abstract:We prospectively compared the efficacy and safety of C_D009428 sulfate or C_D014031 sulfate in conjunction with C_D010878 in 118 immunocompromised patients with presumed severe D_D007239. The two treatment regimens were equally efficacious. NephroD_D064420 occurred in a similar proportion in patients treated with C_D009428 and C_D014031 (17% vs 11%). OtoD_D064420 occurred in four (9.5%) of 42 C_D009428 and C_D010878 and in 12 (22%) of 54 C_D014031 and C_D010878-treated patients. Of those evaluated with posttherapy audiograms, three of four C_D009428 and C_D010878-treated patients had auditory thresholds return to baseline compared with one of nine C_D014031 and C_D010878-treated patients. The number of greater than or equal to 15-dB increases in auditory threshold as a proportion of total greater than or equal to 15-dB changes (increases and decreases) was significantly lower in C_D009428 and C_D010878- vs C_D014031 and C_D010878-treated patients (18 of 78 vs 67 of 115). We conclude that C_D000617-associated otoD_D064420 was less severe and more often reversible with C_D009428 than with C_D014031.

C_D007052, C_D013467, C_D008528, and low dose C_D008469 increased the latency-to-onset in the C_D005481 and/or C_D010433 models; the electroshock, C_D010852 and C_D001640 models were not significantly affected by any of the pretreatment agents. These results suggest that C_D011453 are involved in the mechanism(s) underlying C_D005481- and C_D010433-induced D_D012640, but not C_D010852-, electroshock-, or C_D001640-induced D_D012640.

title:Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-associated D_D000799 of the stomach and small intestine: a case report.
abstract:This is a case report on a 45-year old African-American female with newly diagnosed D_D006973, who was started on a combination pill of C_D017311/C_C044946 10/5 mg. The very next day, she presented at the emergency room (ER) with D_D015746, D_D009325 and D_D014839. Physical exam, complete metabolic panel, and hemogram were in the normal range. She was discharged from the ER after a few hours of treatment with fluid and analgesics. However, she returned to the ER the next day with the same complaints. This time the physical exam was significant for a distended abdomen with dullness to percussion. CT scan of the abdomen revealed markedly thickened antrum of the stomach, duodenum and jejunum, along with fluid in the abdominal and pelvic cavity. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)-induced D_D000799 was suspected, and anti-D_D006973 medications were discontinued. Her symptoms improved within the next 24 hours, and repeat CT after 72 hours revealed marked improvement in stomach and small bowel thickening and resolution of D_D001201. The recognition of C_D000809-converting enzyme (ACE) and C_D000809 receptor blocker (ARB) intestinal D_D000799 constitutes a challenge to primary care physicians, internists, emergency room personal and surgeons.

title:C_D014635 I: time course of lipid peroxidation biomarkers, D_D056486, and C_D014635 metabolite levels in rats.
abstract:A single dose of C_D014635 (C_D014635), which is a widely used antiepileptic drug, is associated with oxidative stress in rats, as recently demonstrated by elevated levels of C_C075750 (C_C075750). To determine whether there was a temporal relationship between C_D014635-associated oxidative stress and D_D056486, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated ip with C_D014635 (500 mg/kg) or 0.9% saline (vehicle) once daily for 2, 4, 7, 10, or 14 days. Oxidative stress was assessed by determining plasma and liver levels of C_C075750, C_D008054 (C_D008054), and C_D017392 (C_D017392). Plasma and liver C_C075750 were elevated and reached a plateau after day 2 of C_D014635 treatment compared to control. Liver C_D008054 levels were not elevated until day 7 of treatment (1.8-fold versus control, p < 0.05). Liver and plasma C_D017392 were not increased until 14 days (2-fold vs. control, p < 0.05). D_D056486 was evaluated based on serum levels of alpha-C_D005978 S-transferase (alpha-GST) and by histology. Serum alpha-GST levels were significantly elevated by day 4, which corresponded to D_D056486 as shown by the increasing incidence of D_D007249 of the liver capsule, D_D009336, and D_D005234 throughout the study. The liver levels of beta-oxidation metabolites of C_D014635 were decreased by day 14, while the levels of 4-ene-C_D014635 and (E)-2,4-diene-C_D014635 were not elevated throughout the study. Overall, these findings indicate that C_D014635 treatment results in oxidative stress, as measured by levels of C_C075750, which precedes the onset of D_D009336, D_D005234, and elevated levels of serum alpha-GST.

title:D_D010673 unmasked by C_C012052 and C_D063325.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: To describe the unmasking of D_D010673 in a patient treated with C_C012052 and C_D063325. CASE SUMMARY: A 42-year-old white man developed acute D_D006973 with severe D_D006261 and D_D014839 2 hours after the first doses of C_C012052 100 mg and C_D063325 100 mg. Both drugs were immediately discontinued, and the patient recovered after subsequent C_D009529 and C_D014700 treatment. Abdominal ultrasound showed an adrenal mass, and postoperative histologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of D_D010673. DISCUSSION: Drug-induced symptoms of D_D010673 are often associated with the use of substituted C_C037689 drugs, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. In our case, use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a possible relationship between the D_D006973 crisis and C_C012052 and C_D063325 therapy. CONCLUSIONS: As of March 24, 2005, this is the first reported case of C_C012052- and C_D063325-induced D_D006973 crisis in a patient with D_D010673. Physicians and other healthcare professionals should be aware of this potential adverse effect of C_D063325 and C_C012052.

title:Quantitative drug levels in stimulant D_D011605: relationship to symptom severity, C_D002395 and D_D006948.
abstract:To examine the relationship between quantitative stimulant drug levels, C_D002395, and D_D011605, nineteen patients in a D_D001523 emergency service with a diagnosis of C_D000661- or C_D003042-induced D_D011605 were interviewed, and plasma and urine were collected for quantitative assays of stimulant drug and C_D002395 metabolite levels. MethC_D000661 or C_D000661 levels were related to several psychopathology scores and the global D_D006948 rating. HVA levels were related to global D_D006948 but not to psychopathology ratings. Although many other factors such as sensitization may play a role, intensity of stimulant-induced D_D011605 and D_D019956 appears to be at least in part dose-related.

title:Delayed D_D006323 D_D006323 after C_D004110 D_D062787; resuscitation with high dose intravenous C_D002118.
abstract:A 51 year old man took a mixed D_D062787 including 1.8-3.6 g of C_D004110, C_D000082, C_D001241, C_D007547 C_D009566, and C_D000431. He initially presented to hospital after six hours with mild D_D007022 and was treated with activated charcoal and intravenous fluids. Eighteen hours after the D_D062787 he had two generalised D_D004830. The patient remained unresponsive with junctional D_D001919, unrecordable blood pressure, and then became D_D006323. He was resuscitated with high dose (13.5 g) intravenous C_D002118 and C_D004837 (C_D004837). He required inotropic support and temporary pacing over the next 48 hours. This case suggests there is a role for aggressive high dose intravenous C_D002118 therapy in severe C_D004110 D_D062787, particularly with the onset of D_D006323. It should be considered early in cases of D_D006323 after C_D004110 D_D062787. The case also highlights the problems with delayed D_D064420 when whole bowel irrigation is not administered.

abstract:A 31-year-old man with D_D001172, who had previously been treated with C_D013467, C_D005279, high dose C_D012459 and C_D006046 salts, developed D_D007681 (D_D007681) 4 months after institution of C_D009288 therapy. No other factor predisposing to D_D007681 could be discovered. C_D013467 was substituted for C_D009288 and no further adverse renal effects occurred over the next 12 months. We review previous reports linking D_D007681 to antiinflammatory drug use and discuss possible advantages of C_D013467 in patients who have experienced D_D007674 from other antiinflammatory agents.

This clinical picture resolved completely with cessation of the combined therapy. Baseline left ventricular function, assessed by cardiac catheterisation or nuclear angiography, was normal in two patients and only mildly reduced in the other. Simultaneously administration of C_D000319 and C_D014700 may result in profound adverse interactions and should only be administered with great caution.

title:Adverse reactions to C_D001539 and C_D011433 for the treatment of mild D_D006973. Report of Medical Research Council Working Party on Mild to Moderate D_D006973.
abstract:Participants in the Medical Research Council treatment trial for mild D_D006973 are randomly allocated to one of four treatment groups: C_D001539, C_D011433, or a placebo for either of these drugs. The trial is single-blind. 23 582 patient-years of observation have been completed so far, 10 684 on active drugs and 12 898 on placebos. The results show an association between C_D001539 treatment and D_D007172, and D_D007172 also occurred more frequently in patients taking C_D011433 than in those taking placebos. Other adverse reactions significantly linked with active drugs include D_D018149 in men and women and D_D006073 in men, associated with C_D001539 treatment, and D_D011928 and D_D004417 in men and women taking C_D011433. No D_D003316 is known to have occurred in the C_D011433 group. Mean serum C_D011188 level fell, and C_D014508 and C_D014527 levels rose, in men and women taking C_D001539. In the C_D011433 group, serum C_D011188 and C_D014527 levels rose in both sexes, but the C_D014508 level rose significantly in women only.

title:C_D020927 and cardiac protection for non-cardiac surgery: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.
abstract:We conducted a systematic review of the effects of C_D020927 on cardiac outcomes following non-cardiac surgery. We included prospective, randomised peri-operative studies of C_D020927 that reported mortality, cardiac morbidity or adverse drug events. A PubMed Central and EMBASE search was conducted up to July 2007. The reference lists of identified papers were examined for further trials. Of 425 studies identified, 20 were included in the meta-analysis (840 patients). C_D020927 was associated with a trend towards improved cardiac outcomes; all-cause mortality (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.01-7.13, p = 0.44), non-fatal D_D009203 (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.04-1.60, p = 0.14), and D_D017202 (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.26-1.63, p = 0.36). Peri-operative D_D007022 (26%, OR 3.80, 95% CI 1.91-7.54, p = 0.0001) and D_D001919 (17%, OR 5.45, 95% CI 2.98-9.95, p < 0.00001) were significantly increased. An anticholinergic did not reduce the incidence of D_D001919 (p = 0.43). A randomised placebo-controlled trial of C_D020927 is warranted.

title:Differential diagnosis of high serum C_D003401 kinase levels in D_D008180.
abstract:We report the clinical and bioptic findings for a 57-year-old woman with severe C_D002738-induced D_D009135. Since 1989, she had been suffering from D_D008180 (D_D008180) with D_D007674 and undergone periods of treatment with C_D001379 and C_D003520. Additional therapy with C_D002738 (C_D002738) was started because of D_D018771. At the same time, slightly increased C_D003401 kinase (CK) levels were noted. D_D009220 was suspected, and the patient was treated with C_D013256. The CK increase persisted, however, and she developed progressive D_D018908 and D_D009133. Routine controls revealed markedly elevated CK levels of 1,700 U/l. The neurological and electrophysiological findings were not typical of D_D009220. Thus, muscle biopsy of the deltoid muscle was performed in order to exclude polyD_D009220 or toxic D_D009135. As it revealed C_D002738-induced D_D009135, medication was stopped. Discriminating between primary D_D008180-induced D_D009140 and drug-induced side effects is important for appropriate treatment of D_D008180 patients.

title:Intravenous C_D012254 treatment for severe D_D000257 in immunocompromised children.
abstract:BACKGROUND: Adenovirus is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised host. The incidence of severe D_D000257 in pediatrics is increasing in association with growing numbers of immunocompromised children, where case fatality rates as high as 50% to 80% have been reported. There are no approved antiviral agents with proven efficacy for the treatment of severe D_D000257, nor are there any prospective randomized, controlled trials of potentially useful anti-adenovirus therapies. Apparent clinical success in the treatment of severe D_D000257 is limited to a few case reports and small series. Experience is greatest with intravenous C_D012254 and C_C059262. C_D012254, a C_D006151 analogue, has broad antiviral activity against both RNA and DNA viruses, including documented activity against adenovirus in vitro. C_D012254 is licensed in aerosol form for the treatment of D_D018357, and orally in combination with interferon to treat D_D006526. Intravenous C_D012254 is the treatment of choice for D_D006482. The most common adverse effect of intravenous C_D012254 is reversible mild D_D000740. The use of C_C059262 in severe D_D000257 has been limited by adverse effects, the most significant of which is D_D007674. OBJECTIVE: We report our experience with intravenous C_D012254 therapy for severe D_D000257 in a series of immunocompromised children and review the literature. DESIGN/METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 5 children treated with intravenous C_D012254 for documented severe D_D000257. Two patients developed adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis after cardiac and bone marrow transplants, respectively. The bone marrow transplant patient also received intravenous C_C059262 for progressive disseminated disease. An additional 3 children developed adenovirus pneumonia; 2 were neonates, 1 of whom had partial D_D004062. The remaining infant had recently undergone a cardiac transplant. Intravenous C_D012254 was administered on a compassionate-use protocol. RESULTS: Complete clinical recovery followed later by viral clearance was observed in 2 children: the cardiac transplant recipient with adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis and the immunocompetent neonate with adenovirus pneumonia. The remaining 3 children died of D_D000257. Intravenous C_D012254 therapy was well tolerated. Use of C_C059262 in 1 child was associated with D_D058186 and D_D009503. DISCUSSION: Our series of patients is representative of the spectrum of immunocompromised children at greatest risk for severe D_D000257, namely solid-organ and bone marrow transplant recipients, neonates, and children with D_D007153. Although intravenous C_D012254 was not effective for all children with severe D_D000257 in this series or in the literature, therapy is unlikely to be of benefit if begun late in the course of the D_D007239. Early identification, eg by polymerase chain reaction of those patients at risk of disseminated D_D000257 may permit earlier antiviral treatment and better evaluation of therapeutic response. CONCLUSIONS: Two of 5 children with severe D_D000257 treated with intravenous C_D012254 recovered. The availability of newer rapid diagnostic techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction, may make earlier, more effective treatment of D_D000257 possible. Given the seriousness and increasing prevalence of D_D000257 in certain hosts, especially children, a large, multicenter clinical trial of potentially useful anti-adenoviral therapies, such as intravenous C_D012254, is clearly required to demonstrate the most effective and least toxic therapy.

title:D_D056486 of C_D000638.
abstract:C_D000638 has proved very effective in the treatment of otherwise resistant cardiac D_D013610. The use of C_D000638 has, however, been limited due to its serious side-effects. A patient with cholestatic hepatitis due to C_D000638 treatment is presented below and a review of the D_D056486 of C_D000638 is given. It is concluded that solid evidence exists of D_D056486 due to C_D000638 treatment, including D_D005234, alterations resembling D_D006519, cholestatic hepatitis and micronodular D_D008103. Patients receiving C_D000638 should be regularly screened with respect to hepatic enzyme levels. Therapy should be discontinued on the suspicion of D_D002779 or D_D006529.

title:D_D002375 induced by combinations of C_D007649 and C_D009020: potentiation, antagonism, tolerance and cross-tolerance in the rat.
abstract:Previous studies demonstrated that both C_D007649 and C_D009020 induced D_D000699 and D_D002375 in the rat. Pre-treatment with C_D007649 produced cross-tolerance to C_D009020, whereas pretreatment with C_D009020 did not induce cross-tolerance to C_D007649 but rather augmented the D_D002375 response; this augmentation was attributed to residual C_D009020 in the brain. The present studies explored the duration of the loss of righting reflex induced by sub-effective doses of C_D007649 and C_D009020, administered simultaneously. There was mutual potentiation between sub-effective doses of C_D007649 and C_D009020, but sub-effective doses of C_D007649 partly antagonized fully-effective doses of C_D009020. Latency to the loss of righting reflex, D_D009127 and behavior on recovery, reflected the relative predominance of C_D007649 or C_D009020 in each combination. C_D009270 inhibited the induced D_D002375 effects. The degree and time course of development of tolerance to daily administration of sub-effective dose combinations of C_D007649 and C_D009020 were similar. Rats, tolerant to C_D007649-dominant combinations, were cross-tolerant to both drugs, while those tolerant to C_D009020-dominant combinations were cross-tolerant to C_D009020 but showed either no cross-tolerance or an augmented response to C_D007649. While the mutual potentiation, antagonism and tolerance suggest common mechanisms for the induced D_D002375, differences in latency, D_D009127 and behavior, asymmetry of cross-tolerance and a widely-different ID50 for C_D009270 would argue against an action at a single opioid site.

abstract:D_D051437 developed after a prolonged course of C_D014640 therapy in 2 patients who were receiving C_C096918 disoproxil fumarate as part of an antiretroviral regimen. C_C096918 has been implicated in the development of D_D005198 and D_D051437 because of its effects on the proximal renal tubule. C_D014640 D_D007674 is infrequent but may result from coadministration with a D_D007674 agent. Clinicians should be aware that C_C096918 may raise the risk of D_D051437 during prolonged administration of C_D014640.

title:Delayed D_D056784 with D_D020521-like presentation in chemotherapy recipients.
abstract:BACKGROUND: A transient D_D056784 mimicking D_D002544 has been described as a complication of chemotherapy, most commonly in recipients of intrathecal C_D008727 for childhood D_D007938. Recently published neuroimaging data suggest a common pathophysiology associated with a variety of chemotherapy agents and modes of administration. METHODS: We reviewed the medical literature for single reports and case series of patients presenting with D_D020521-like episodes while receiving systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy. We only included studies providing detailed neuroimaging data. Patients with D_D002544s were excluded. RESULTS: We identified 27 reports of toxic D_D056784 in patients treated with C_D008727 (intrathecal, systemic), C_D005472 and its derivative C_C017367, and C_C110904. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) of all patients revealed well demarcated hyperintense D_D056784 of the cerebral hemispheres and the corpus callosum, corresponding to areas of decreased proton diffusion on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps (available in 21/27 patients). Lesions exceeded the confines of adjacent vascular territories. Complete resolution of symptoms within 1-4 days was accompanied by normalisation of ADC abnormalities. However, fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences frequently revealed persistent D_D056784. CONCLUSIONS: Several pathophysiological models of delayed D_D056784 after exposure to intrathecal or systemic chemotherapy have been proposed. DWI findings in this cohort are indicative of D_D001929 and lend support to an at least partially reversible metabolic derangement as the basis for this syndrome.

title:Down-regulation of C_D009638 transporter function induced by chronic administration of C_D003891 linking to the alteration of sensitivity of local-anesthetics-induced D_D012640 and the counteraction by co-administration with local anesthetics.
abstract:Alterations of C_D009638 transporter (NET) function by chronic inhibition of NET in relation to sensitization to D_D012640 induce by C_D003042 and local anesthetics were studied in mice. Daily administration of C_D003891, an inhibitor of the NET, for 5 days decreased [(3)H]C_D009638 uptake in the P2 fractions of hippocampus but not cortex, striatum or amygdalae. Co-administration of C_D008012, C_D002045 or C_C003636 with C_D003891 reversed this effect. Daily treatment of C_D003042 increased [(3)H]C_D009638 uptake into the hippocampus. Daily administration of C_D003891 increased the incidence of appearance of C_D008012-induced D_D012640 and decreased that of C_D003042-induced D_D012640. Co-administration of C_D008012 with C_D003891 reversed the changes of D_D012640 activity of C_D008012 and C_D003042 induced by repeated administration of C_D003891. These results suggest that down-regulation of hippocampal NET induced by chronic administration of C_D003891 may be relevant to C_D003891-induced sensitization of C_D008012 D_D012640. Inhibition of C_D012964(+) channels by local anesthetics may regulate C_D003891-induced down-regulation of NET function. Repeated administration of C_D003042 induces up-regulation of hippocampal NET function. C_D003891-induced sensitization of C_D008012 D_D012640 may have a mechanism distinct from kindling resulting from repeated administration of C_D003042.

title:Definition and management of D_D000740 in patients D_D006526.
abstract:D_D019698 (HCV) can progress to D_D005355, D_D006528, and D_D058625. The current best treatment for D_D006526 is combination therapy with pegylated C_D007372 and C_D012254. Although this regimen produces sustained virologic responses (SVRs) in approximately 50% of patients, it can be associated with a potentially dose-limiting hemolytic D_D000740. Hemoglobin concentrations decrease mainly as a result of C_D012254-induced D_D006461, and this D_D000740 can be problematic in patients with D_D006526, especially those who have comorbid renal or cardiovascular disorders. In general, D_D000740 can increase the risk of morbidity and mortality, and may have negative effects on cerebral function and quality of life. Although C_D012254-associated D_D000740 can be reversed by dose reduction or discontinuation, this approach compromises outcomes by significantly decreasing SVR rates. Recombinant human erythropoietin has been used to manage C_D012254-associated D_D000740 but has other potential disadvantages. C_C026956, a liver-targeting prodrug of C_D012254, has the potential to maintain the virologic efficacy of C_D012254 while decreasing the risk of hemolytic D_D000740 in patients with D_D019698.

title:C_D002119 D_D064420: the updated D_D006934; report of 3 cases and review of the literature.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: To describe 3 patients with C_D002119-induced D_D006934 and gain insights into the cause and management of the D_D006934. METHODS: We report the clinical and laboratory data in 3 patients who presented with severe D_D006934 (corrected serum C_D002118 > or = 14 mg/dL) and review the pertinent literature on D_D006934. RESULTS: The 3 patients had D_D058186, relative D_D000471, and low parathyroid hormone (PTH), PTH-related peptide, and C_C097949 concentrations. No malignant lesion was found. Treatment included aggressive hydration and varied amounts of C_D005665. The 2 patients with the higher serum C_D002118 concentrations received C_C019248 intravenously (60 and 30 mg, respectively), which caused severe D_D006996. Of the 3 patients, 2 were ingesting acceptable doses of elemental C_D002118 (1 g and 2 g daily, respectively) in the form of C_D002119. In addition to our highlighted cases, we review the history, classification, pathophysiologic features, and treatment of D_D006934 and summarize the cases reported from early 1995 to November 2003. CONCLUSION: D_D006934 may be a common cause of unexplained D_D006934 and can be precipitated by small amounts of orally ingested C_D002119 in susceptible persons. Treatment with hydration, C_D005665, and discontinuation of the C_D002118 and C_D014807 source is adequate. C_C019248 treatment is associated with considerable risk for D_D006996, even in cases of initially severe D_D006934.

title:Management strategies for C_D012254-induced D_D000743 in the treatment of D_D006526: clinical and economic implications.
abstract:OBJECTIVES: Recently published studies have demonstrated increased efficacy and cost-effectiveness of combination therapy with interferon and alpha-2b/C_D012254 compared with C_D016898 monotherapy in the treatment of chronic D_D006526 (D_D019698). Combination therapy is associated with a clinically important adverse effect: C_D012254-induced D_D000743 (D_D000743). The objective of this study was to evaluate the direct health-care costs and management of D_D000743 during treatment of D_D019698 in a clinical trial setting. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize information on the incidence and management of D_D000743. Decision-analytic techniques were used to estimate the cost of treating D_D000743. Uncertainty was evaluated using sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: D_D000743, defined as a reduction in hemoglobin to less than 100 g/L, occurs in approximately 7% to 9% of patients treated with combination therapy. The standard of care for management of D_D000743 is reduction or discontinuation of the C_D012254 dosage. We estimated the direct cost of treating clinically significant D_D000743 to be  170 per patient receiving combination therapy per 48-week treatment course (range  68- 692). The results of the one-way sensitivity analyses ranged from  57 to  317. In comparison, the cost of 48 weeks of combination therapy is  16,459. CONCLUSIONS: The direct cost of treating clinically significant D_D000743 is 1% ( 170/ 16,459) of drug treatment costs. Questions remain about the optimal dose of C_D012254 and the incidence of D_D000743 in a real-world population. Despite these uncertainties, this initial evaluation of the direct cost of treating D_D000743 provides an estimate of the cost and management implications of this clinically important adverse effect.

title:Effects of C_D000588 pretreatment on ketC_D000588 D_D002389 in pinealectomized or hypophysectomized animals.
abstract:The present studies were designed to clarify the role of catecholC_D000588s and pineal idolC_D000588s on ketC_D000588-induced D_D002389 in the intact, pinealectomized or hypophysectomized chick and rat. In the pinealectomized chick, pretreatment with dopC_D000588 increased the duration of D_D002389 (DOC) after ketC_D000588, but pretreatment with C_D009638 did not. The pineal indolC_D000588s exhibited mixed actions. C_D012701 and C_C006389 which augmented ketC_D000588 DOC, did not do so in the absence of the pineal gland, whereas C_D008550 potentiated the ketC_D000588 DOC in both the intact and pinealectomized chick. KetC_D000588 was more potent in the hypophysectomized chick and the circadian rhythm noted in the intact chick was absent; furthermore, C_D008550 did not augment the ketC_D000588 DOC whereas dopC_D000588 continued to do so. This study did not demonstrate a species difference regarding the role of the C_D000588s on the pineal in spite of the immature blood-brain barrier in the young chick and the intact barrier in the rat. In addition, these data indicate a direct role of the pituitary in the augmentation of ketC_D000588 DOC induced by C_D008550. Furthermore, dopC_D000588 appeared to act on systems more closely involved with the induction of ketC_D000588 D_D002389 rather than directly on the pituitary.

title:Multicenter, double-blind, multiple-dose, parallel-groups efficacy and safety trial of C_C020976, C_D002744, and placebo in the treatment of D_D006255.
abstract:C_C020976, a novel antiallergic medication, was compared with C_D002744 maleate and placebo for efficacy and safety in the treatment of D_D006255 in a multicenter, double-blind, multiple-dose, parallel-groups study. One hundred fifty-five subjects participated. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 60 years of age and had at least a 2-year history of D_D006255, confirmed by positive skin test to spring aeroallergens. Medications were given four times daily; the C_C020976 groups received 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg in the morning and evening with placebo in the early and late afternoon; the C_D002744 group received 4.0 mg four times daily. Daily subject symptom cards were completed during a screening period to assess pretreatment symptoms and during a 4-week treatment period while subjects received study medications. Individual symptoms, total symptoms, and major symptoms were compared to determine efficacy of medication. Elicited, volunteered, and observed adverse experiences were recorded for each subject and compared among groups. Vital signs, body weights, serum chemistry values, complete blood cell counts, urine studies, and electrocardiograms were obtained for each subject and compared among groups. Symptoms relief in the group receiving the highest concentration of C_C020976 (2.0 mg twice daily) was statistically greater than in the placebo group during all weeks of the study. Lower doses of C_C020976 were statistically more effective than placebo only during portions of the first 3 weeks of the study. In contrast, although the C_D002744 group did have fewer symptoms than the placebo group during the study, the difference never reached statistical significance during any week of the study. There were no serious side effects in any of the treatment groups. D_D006970 and D_D013651 were increased significantly over placebo only in the high-dose C_C020976 group. C_C020976 appears to be a safe, efficacious medication for D_D006255.

The powders had been obtained from pharmacists unknown to the patients' medical practitioners. It is suggested that these preparations were responsible for the patient's problems, and that such powders should no longer be freely obtainable.

title:Prolonged D_D010243 due to C_D003473 and C_D000305.
abstract:The long-term use of C_D003473 (C_D003473) has recently been implicated as a cause of prolonged D_D018908, although the site of the lesion and the predisposing factors have been unclear. We report 3 patients (age 37-52 years) with acute D_D012131 who developed prolonged D_D018908 following the discontinuation of C_D003473s. Two patients also received intravenous C_D000305. Renal function was normal but hepatic function was impaired in all patients, and all had D_D000138. Electrophysiologic studies revealed low amplitude compound motor action potentials, normal sensory studies, and fibrillations. Repetitive stimulation at 2 Hz showed a decremental response in 2 patients. The serum C_D014673 level measured in 1 patient 14 days after the drug had been discontinued was 172 ng/mL. A muscle biopsy in this patient showed D_D009135. The D_D018908 in these patients is due to D_D009468 (most likely due to C_D003473) and muscle (most likely due to C_D000305). D_D008107 and D_D000138 are contributing risk factors.

title:C_D015232-induced D_D053201 in normal, conscious rats: involvement of C_D015320?
abstract:In normal conscious rats investigated by continuous cystometry, intravesically instilled C_D015232 facilitated micturition and increased basal intravesical pressure. The effect was attenuated by both the NK1 receptor selective antagonist C_C071693 and the NK2 receptor selective antagonist C_C073839, given intra-arterially, suggesting that it was mediated by stimulation of both NK1 and NK2 receptors. Intra-arterially given C_D015232 produced a distinct increase in bladder pressure before initiating a micturition reflex, indicating that the C_D011453 had a direct contractant effect on the detrusor smooth muscle. The effect of intra-arterial C_D015232 could not be blocked by intra-arterial C_C071693 or C_C073839, which opens the possibility that the micturition reflex elicited by intra-arterial C_D015232 was mediated by pathways other than the reflex initiated when the C_D011453 was given intravesically. The present results thus suggest that intra-arterial C_D015232, given near the bladder, may initiate micturition in the normal rat chiefly by directly contracting the smooth muscle of the detrusor. However, when given intravesically, C_D015232 may stimulate micturition by releasing C_D015320 from nerves in and/or immediately below the urothelium. These C_D015320, in turn, initiate a micturition reflex by stimulating NK1 and NK2 receptors. C_D011453 may, via release of C_D015320, contribute to both urge and D_D053201 seen in inflammatory conditions of the lower urinary tract.

title:C_D049971 diuretics, D_D007008 and D_D001145.
abstract:C_D049971 diuretics are widely accepted as the cornerstone of antihypertensive treatment programs. D_D007008 is a commonly encountered metabolic consequence of chronic C_D049971 therapy. We treated 38 patients (22 low renin, 16 normal renin) with moderate D_C563897 with hydrochloroC_D049971 (C_D006852) administered on a twice daily schedule. Initial dose was 50 mg and the dose was increased at monthly intervals to 100 mg, 150 mg and 200 mg daily until blood pressure normalized. The serum C_D011188 during the control period was 4.5 +/- 0.2 mEq/l an on 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg C_D006852 daily 3.9 +/- 0.3, 3.4 +/- 0.2, 2.9 +/- 0.2, and 2.4 +/- 0.3 mEq/l, respectively. Corresponding figures for whole body C_D011188 were 4107 +/- 208, 3722 +/- 319, 3628 +/- 257, 3551 +/- 336, and 3269 +/- 380 mEq, respectively. In 13 patients we observed the effects of C_D006852 therapy (100 mg daily) on the occurrence of PVC's during rest as well as during static and dynamic exercise. During rest we observed 0.6 +/- 0.08 PVC beats/min +/- SEM and during static and dynamic exercise 0.6 +/- 0.06 and 0.8 +/- 0.15, respectively. Corresponding figures during C_D006852 therapy 100 mg daily were 1.4 +/- 0.1, 3.6 +/- 0.7 and 5.7 4/- 0.8, respectively. The occurrence of PVC's correlated significantly with the fall in serum C_D011188+ observed r = 0.72, p less than 0.001. In conclusion we found that C_D049971 diuretics cause D_D007008 and depletion of body C_D011188. The more profound D_D007008, the greater the propensity for the occurrence of PVC's.

title:Diuretics, C_D011188 and D_D001145 in D_D006973 D_D003327.
abstract:It has been proposed that modest changes in plasma C_D011188 can alter the tendency towards cardiac D_D001145. If this were so, patients with D_D003324 might be especially susceptible. Thus, myocardial electrical excitability was measured in patients with mild essential D_D006973 and known D_D003324 after 8 weeks of treatment with a C_D011188-conserving diuretic (C_D000584) and a similar period on a C_D011188-losing diuretic (C_D002752) in a randomised study. Plasma C_D011188 concentrations were on average 1 mmol/L lower during the C_D002752 phase compared to C_D000584 therapy. Blood pressure and volume states as assessed by bodyweight, plasma renin and C_D009638 (C_D009638) concentrations were similar on the 2 regimens. Compared to C_D000584 treatment, the C_D002752 phase was associated with an increased frequency of D_D018879 (24-hour Holter monitoring) and a higher Lown grading, increased upslope and duration of the monophasic action potential, prolonged ventricular effective refractory period, and increased electrical instability during programmed ventricular stimulation. The above results indicate that because C_D011188-losing diuretic therapy can increase myocardial electrical excitability in patients with D_D017202, even minor falls in plasma C_D011188 concentrations are probably best avoided in such patients.

title:C_D005680 involvement in C_D009270 induced reversal of D_D012133 produced by C_D013874.
abstract:No agent is yet available to reverse D_D012133 produced by CNS depressants, such as general anesthetics. In this study C_D009270 reversed D_D012133 induced by C_D013874 in rats. 25 mg/kg, i.v. C_D013874 produced anesthesia without altering respiratory rate, increased C_D005680, decreased C_D018698, and had no effect on C_D001224 or C_D005998 levels compared to controls in rat cortex and brain stem. Pretreatment of rats with C_C005151 for 30 minutes abolished the anesthetic action as well as the respiratory depressant action of C_D013874. 50 mg/kg, i.v. C_D013874 produced D_D012131 with further increase in C_D005680 and decrease in C_D018698 again in cortex and brain stem without affecting any of the C_D000596 studied in four regions of rat brain. C_D009270 (2.5 mg/kg, i.v.) reversed D_D012133, C_D018698 and C_D005680 levels to control values in brain stem and cortex with no changes in caudate or cerebellum. These data suggest C_D009270 reverses D_D012133 produced by C_D013874 and involves C_D005680 in its action.

title:National project on the prevention of mother-to-infant D_D006509 in Japan.
abstract:In Japan, a nationwide prevention program against mother-to-infant D_D006509 (HBV) started in 1985. This program consists of double screenings of pregnant women and prophylactic treatment to the infants born to both C_D006514 (C_D006514) and C_D006513 (C_D006513) positive mothers. These infants are treated with two injections of D_D006509 immune globulin (HBIG) and at least three injections of plasma derived D_D006509 vaccine. We sent questionnaires about the numbers of each procedure or examination during nine months of investigation period to each local government in 1986 and 1987. 93.4% pregnant women had the chance to be examined for C_D006514, and the positive rate was 1.4 to 1.5%. The C_D006513 positive rate in C_D006514 positive was 23 to 26%. The C_D006514 positive rate in neonates and in infants before two months were 3% and 2% respectively. Some problems may arise, because 27 to 30% of infants need the fourth vaccination in some restricted areas.

title:Nociceptive effects induced by intrathecal administration of C_D015230, E2, or F2 alpha to conscious mice.
abstract:The effects of intrathecal administration of C_D011453 on D_D010146 responses in conscious mice were evaluated by using hot plate and C_D019342 writhing tests. C_D015230 (0.5-3 ng/mouse) had a D_D006930 action on the response to a hot plate during a 3-60 min period after injection. C_D015232 showed a D_D006930 effect at doses of 1 C_D011453 to 10 ng/mouse, but the effect lasted shorter (3-30 min) than that of C_D015230. Similar results were obtained by C_D019342 writhing tests. The D_D006930 effect of C_D015230 was blocked by simultaneous injection of a substance P antagonist (greater than or equal to 100 ng) but not by C_C053876, a prostanoid EP1-receptor antagonist. Conversely, C_D015232-induced D_D006930 was blocked by C_C053876 (greater than or equal to 500 ng) but not by the substance P antagonist. C_D015237 had little effect on D_D010146 responses. These results demonstrate that both C_D015230 and C_D015232 exert D_D006930 in the spinal cord, but in different ways.

title:Swallowing-induced D_D013617 triggered by C_D000420: case report and review of the literature.
abstract:CASE: A 49-year-old patient experienced chest discomfort while swallowing. On electrocardiogram, episodes of D_D013617 were recorded immediately after swallowing; 24-hour Holter monitoring recorded several events. The D_D001145 resolved after therapy with C_D001262, but recurred a year later. The patient noticed that before these episodes he had been using an inhalator of C_D000420. After stopping the beta-agonist, and after a week with the C_D001262, the D_D001145 disappeared. DISCUSSION: Swallowing-induced D_D013617 (D_D013617) is a rare phenomenon. Fewer than 50 cases of D_D013617 have been described in the literature. This article summarizes all the cases published, creating a comprehensive review of the current knowledge and approach to D_D013617. It discusses demographics, clinical characteristics and types of D_D001145, postulated mechanisms of D_D013617, and different treatment possibilities such as medications, surgery, and radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA). CONCLUSION: C_D000420 is presented here as a possible trigger for D_D013617. Although it is difficult to define causality in a case report, it is logical to think that a beta-agonist like C_D000420 (known to induce D_D013610) may be the trigger of adrenergic reflexes originating in the esophagus while swallowing and that a beta-blocker such as C_D001262 (that blocks the adrenergic activity) may relieve it.

title:C_C024989 treatment ameliorates acute C_D002945 D_D007674 in mice.
abstract:The nephroprotective effect of C_C024989 was investigated in mice with D_D058186 induced by a single i.p. injection of C_D002945 (5 mg/kg). C_C024989 treatment (10 mg/kg/day, i.p.) was applied for 6 consecutive days, starting 1 day before C_D002945 administration. C_C024989 significantly reduced C_D001806 and serum C_D003404 levels which were increased by C_D002945. C_C024989 significantly compensated deficits in the antioxidant defense mechanisms (C_D005978 level and C_D013481 dismutase activity), suppressed lipid peroxidation, decreased the elevations of D_D009369 D_D009336 factor-alpha, C_D009569 and C_D010984 ion concentration, and attenuated the reductions of C_D012643 and C_D015032 ions in renal tissue resulted from C_D002945 administration. Also, histopathological D_D007674 mediated by C_D002945 was ameliorated by C_C024989 treatment. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that C_C024989 significantly decreased the C_D002945-induced overexpression of inducible C_D009569 synthase, nuclear factor-kappaB, caspase-3 and p53 in renal tissue. It was concluded that C_C024989 represents a potential therapeutic option to protect against acute C_D002945 D_D007674 commonly encountered in clinical practice.

title:C_D008687 prevents experimental C_D005839-induced D_D007674 by a mitochondria-dependent pathway.
abstract:The antidiabetic drug C_D008687 can diminish apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in endothelial cells and prevent D_D014652 even in nondiabetic patients. Here we tested whether it has a beneficial effect in a rat model of C_D005839 D_D064420. Mitochondrial analysis, respiration intensity, levels of reactive C_D010100 species, permeability transition, and cytochrome c release were assessed 3 and 6 days after C_D005839 administration. C_D008687 treatment fully blocked C_D005839-mediated D_D058186. This was accompanied by a lower activity of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, together with a decrease of lipid peroxidation and increase of antioxidant systems. C_D008687 also protected the kidney from histological damage 6 days after C_D005839 administration. These in vivo markers of D_D007674 and their correction by C_D008687 were complemented by in vitro studies of mitochondrial function. We found that C_D005839 treatment depleted respiratory components (cytochrome c, NADH), probably due to the opening of mitochondrial transition pores. These injuries, partly mediated by a rise in reactive C_D010100 species from the electron transfer chain, were significantly decreased by C_D008687. Thus, our study suggests that pleiotropic effects of C_D008687 can lessen C_D005839 nephroD_D064420 and improve mitochondrial homeostasis.

title:Sedation depth during spinal anesthesia and the development of postoperative D_D003693 in elderly patients undergoing D_D006620 repair.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: To determine whether limiting intraoperative sedation depth during spinal anesthesia for D_D006620 repair in elderly patients can decrease the prevalence of postoperative D_D003693. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a double-blind, randomized controlled trial at an academic medical center of elderly patients (>or=65 years) without preoperative D_D003693 or severe D_D003704 who underwent D_D006620 repair under spinal anesthesia with C_D015742 sedation. Sedation depth was titrated using processed electroencephalography with the bispectral index (BIS), and patients were randomized to receive either deep (BIS, approximately 50) or light (BIS, >or=80) sedation. Postoperative D_D003693 was assessed as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of D_D001523 (Third Edition Revised) criteria using the Confusion Assessment Method beginning at any time from the second day after surgery. RESULTS: From April 2, 2005, through October 30, 2008, a total of 114 patients were randomized. The prevalence of postoperative D_D003693 was significantly lower in the light sedation group (11/57 [19%] vs 23/57 [40%] in the deep sedation group; P=.02), indicating that 1 incident of D_D003693 will be prevented for every 4.7 patients treated with light sedation. The mean +/- SD number of days of D_D003693 during hospitalization was lower in the light sedation group than in the deep sedation group (0.5+/-1.5 days vs 1.4+/-4.0 days; P=.01). CONCLUSION: The use of light C_D015742 sedation decreased the prevalence of postoperative D_D003693 by 50% compared with deep sedation. Limiting depth of sedation during spinal anesthesia is a simple, safe, and cost-effective intervention for preventing postoperative D_D003693 in elderly patients that could be widely and readily adopted.

title:C_C471405-induced acute D_D009203 due to D_D003329.
abstract:A 65-year-old man with advanced D_D002292 was admitted due to continuing D_D002637 at rest. Two weeks before his admission, C_C471405 had been started. He was diagnosed with non-ST-elevation D_D009203 by laboratory data and electrocardiogram. Enhanced heart magnetic resonance imaging also showed D_D009203. However, there was no stenosis in coronary arteries on angiography. D_D003329 was induced by a provocative test. Cessation of C_C471405 and administration of C_D002118-channel blocker and C_D009566 ameliorated his symptoms, but relapse occurred after resumption of C_C471405. Addition of oral C_D020108 reduced his symptoms and maintained D_D060050 status. We report the first case of C_C471405-induced D_D003329. C_C471405 is a multikinase inhibitor that targets signaling pathways necessary for cellular proliferation and survival. On the other hand, the Rho/ROCK pathway has an important role in the pathogenesis of D_D003329. Our report may show an adverse effect on the Rho/ROCK pathway by C_C471405 use.

title:Anxiogenic potential of C_D002939 and C_D009643 in rats.
abstract:INTRODUCTION: The possible anxiogenic effects of C_D024841, namely C_D002939 and C_D009643, were investigated in adult Charles Foster albino rats of either sex, weighing 150-200 g. METHODS: The drugs were given orally, in doses of 50 mg/kg for five consecutive days and the experiments were performed on the fifth day. The tests included open-field exploratory behaviour, elevated plus maze and elevated zero maze, social interaction and novelty-suppressed feeding latency behaviour. RESULTS: The results indicate that C_D002939- and C_D009643-treated rats showed D_D001008 in comparison to control rats in all the parameters studied. However, C_D002939- and C_D009643-treated rats did not differ significantly from each other in various behavioural parameters. CONCLUSION: The present experimental findings substantiate the clinically observed anxiogenic potential of C_D002939 and C_D009643.

title:Myocardial Fas ligand expression increases susceptibility to C_D015215-induced D_D009202.
abstract:BACKGROUND: Dilated D_D009202 (D_D002311) and D_D009205 occur in many D_D015658 individuals, resulting in symptomatic D_D006333 in up to 5% of patients. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has significantly reduced morbidity and mortality of D_D000163 (D_D000163), but has resulted in an increase in D_C538496. METHODS AND RESULTS: In order to investigate whether the HAART component C_D015215 (C_D015215; C_D015215) triggers the Fas-dependent cell-death pathway and cause cytoskeletal disruption in a murine model of D_D002311, 8-week-old transgenic (expressing Fas ligand in the myocardium: FasL Tg) and non-transgenic (NTg) mice received water ad libitum containing different concentrations of C_D015215 (0, 0.07, 0.2, and 0.7 mg/ml). After 6 weeks, cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography and morphology was assessed by histopathologic and immunohistochemical methods. NTg and untreated FasL Tg mice showed little or no change in cardiac structure or function. In contrast, C_D015215-treated FasL Tg mice developed D_D002311 and depressed cardiac function in a dose-dependent manner, with concomitant inflammatory infiltration of both ventricles. These changes were associated with an increased sarcolemmal expression of Fas and FasL, as well as increased activation of caspase 3, translocation of calpain 1 to the sarcolemma and sarcomere, and increased numbers of cells undergoing apoptosis. These were associated with changes in dystrophin and cardiac troponin I localization, as well as loss of sarcolemmal integrity. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of Fas ligand in the myocardium, as identified in HIV-positive patients, might increase the susceptibility to HAART-induced D_D009202 due to activation of apoptotic pathways, resulting in D_D002311 and dysfunction.

title:C_D014635-induced D_D002819 and D_D001927 in atypical D_D020158.
abstract:D_D020158 is a D_D000592 in which a defect in the C_D005998 cleavage system leads to an accumulation of C_D005998 in the brain and other body compartments. In the classical form it presents as neonatal D_D001049, intractable D_D012640, and D_D009123, followed by significant D_D011596. An important subset of children with D_D020158 are atypical variants who present in a heterogeneous manner. This report describes a patient with mild D_D007805 and D_D008607, who was found to have D_D020158 following her presentation with acute D_D001927 and D_D002819 shortly after initiation of C_D014635 therapy.

title:Microinjection of C_D016713 into the CA1 region of hippocampus improves C_D012601-induced D_D000647 in adult male rats.
abstract:The effect of C_D016713 (5-HT2 antagonist) on C_D012601 (muscarinic cholinergic antagonist)-induced D_D000647 in Morris water maze (MWM) was investigated. Rats were divided into eight groups and bilaterally cannulated into CA1 region of the hippocampus. One week later, they received repeatedly vehicles (saline, C_D004121, saline+C_D004121), C_D012601 (2 microg/0.5 microl saline/side; 30 min before training), C_D016713 (2, 4 and 8 microg/0.5 microl C_D004121/side; 20 min before training) and C_D012601 (2 microg/0.5 microl; 30 min before C_D016713 injection)+C_D016713 (4 microg/0.5 microl C_D004121) through cannulae each day. Animals were tested for four consecutive days (4 trial/day) in MWM during which the position of hidden platform was unchanged. In the fifth day, the platform was elevated above the water surface in another position to evaluate the function of motor, motivational and visual systems. The results showed a significant increase in escape latencies and traveled distances to find platform in C_D012601-treated group as compared to saline group. C_D016713-treated rats (4 microg/0.5 microl/side) showed a significant decrease in the mentioned parameters as compared to C_D004121-treated group. However, C_D012601 and C_D016713 co-administration resulted in a significant decrease in escape latencies and traveled distances as compared to the C_D012601-treated rats. Our findings show that microinjection of C_D016713 into the CA1 region of the hippocampus improves the C_D012601-induced D_D000647.

title:D_D000860 in D_D007674 with D_D011507 and/or glomerular D_D006973.
abstract:Despite the increasing need to identify and quantify tissue oxygenation at the cellular level, relatively few methods have been available. In this study, we developed a new D_D000860-responsive reporter vector using a D_D000860-responsive element of the 5' vascular endothelial growth factor untranslated region and generated a novel D_D000860-sensing transgenic rat. We then applied this animal model to the detection of tubulointerstitial D_D000860 in the D_D007674. With this model, we were able to identify diffuse cortical D_D000860 in the C_D011692-induced D_D009404 and focal and segmental D_D000860 in the remnant kidney model. Expression of the D_D000860-responsive transgene increased throughout the observation period, reaching 2.2-fold at 2 weeks in the C_D011692 model and 2.6-fold at 4 weeks in the remnant kidney model, whereas that of vascular endothelial growth factor showed a mild decrease, reflecting distinct behaviors of the two genes. The degree of D_D000860 showed a positive correlation with microscopic D_-1 in both models. Finally, we identified the localization of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive, ED-1-positive, and terminal dUTP nick-end labeled-positive cells in the D_D000860 cortical area in the remnant kidney model. We propose here a possible pathological tie between chronic tubulointerstitial D_D000860 and progressive D_D007674.

title:Consensus statement concerning D_D066126 occurring during haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the treatment of D_D001327, with special reference to D_D012595 and D_D009103.
abstract:Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is now a feasible and effective treatment for selected patients with severe D_D001327. Worldwide, over 650 patients have been transplanted in the context of phase I and II clinical trials. The results are encouraging enough to begin randomised phase III trials. However, as predicted, significant transplant-related morbidity and mortality have been observed. This is primarily due to complications related to either the stage of the disease at transplant or due to D_D007239. The number of deaths related to D_D066126 is low. However, caution is required when C_D003520 or C_D018943 such as C_D008942 are used in patients with a possible underlying D_D006331, for example, D_D012595 patients. In November 2002, a meeting was held in Florence, bringing together a number of experts in various fields, including rheumatology, cardiology, neurology, pharmacology and transplantation medicine. The object of the meeting was to analyse existing data, both published or available, in the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation D_D001327 database, and to propose a safe approach to such patients. A full cardiological assessment before and during the transplant emerged as the major recommendation.

abstract:D_D001167 induced in rats by vasodilators, C_D018818 and C_D013806, was examined immunohistochemically for expressions of inducible type of C_D009569 synthase (iNOS), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and D_D009369 growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). Rats were administered C_D018818 for 24 hours by intravenous infusion with or without following repeated daily oral administrations of C_D013806. Irrespective of C_D013806 administration, iNOS antigens were remarkably abundant in ED-1-positive cells on day 5 and 8 post-C_D018818-infusion (DPI); bFGF antigens were remarkably abundant in ED-1-positive cells on 1 and 3 DPI; TGF-beta1 antigens were observed in ED-1-positive cells on and after 5 DPI. These results suggest that the peak expression of iNOS antigen was followed by that of bFGF antigen, and bFGF may have a suppressive effect on iNOS expression in these rat D_D001167 models. On the other hand, TGF-beta1 was not considered to have a suppressive effect on iNOS expression in these models.

title:C_D006495 for the treatment of patients with mechanical heart valves.
abstract:BACKGROUND: The interruption of oral anticoagulant (OAC) administration is sometimes indicated in patients with mechanical heart valves, mainly before noncardiac surgery, non-surgical interventions, and pregnancy. C_D006493 (C_D006493) is currently the substitute for selected patients. C_D006495 (C_D006495) offers theoretical advantages over C_D006493, but is not currently considered in clinical guidelines as an alternative to C_D006493 in patients with prosthetic valves. HYPOTHESIS: The aim of the present study was to review the data accumulated so far on the use of C_D006495 in this patient population and to discuss its applicability in common practice. METHODS: For this paper, the current medical literature on C_D006495 in patients with mechanical heart valves was extensively reviewed. RESULTS: There were eight series and six case reports. None of the studies was randomized, and only one was prospective. Data to establish the D_D013923 risk were incomplete. After excluding case reports, the following groups were constructed: (a) short-term administration, after valve insertion (n = 212); (b) short-term, perioperative (noncardiac)/periprocedural (n = 114); (c) long-term, due to intolerance to OAC (n = 16); (d) long-term, in pregnancy (n = 10). The incidence rate of D_D013923 was 0.9% for all the studies and 0.5, 0, 20, and 0% in groups a, b, c, and d, respectively; for D_D006470, the overall rate was 3.4% (3.8, 2.6, 10, and 0% for the respective groups). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mechanical heart valves, short-term C_D006495 therapy compares favorably with C_D006493. Data on mid- and long-term C_D006495 administration in these patients are sparse. Further randomized studies are needed to confirm the safety and precise indications for the use of C_D006495 in patients with mechanical heart valves.

title:C_C052342-induced D_D053040.
abstract:C_C052342 is a recently developed antiepileptic medication that is becoming more widely prescribed because of its efficacy in treating D_D004827. Urologists should be aware that this medication can cause D_D000138 in patients secondary to inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. In addition, a distal tubular acidification defect may result, thus impairing the normal compensatory drop in urine pH. These factors can lead to the development of C_C020243 D_D053040. We report the first two cases of C_C052342-induced D_D053040 in the urologic literature.

title:C_D013148: is it a novel drug for the prevention of C_D000666-related D_D007008 in D_D009369 patients?
abstract:OBJECTIVE: D_D007674 is the major adverse effect of C_D000666 (C_D000666), often limiting administration of full dosage. Selective distal tubular epithelial D_D064420 seems to be responsible for the profound C_D011188 wasting that is a major clinical side effect of treatment with C_D000666. C_D011188 depletion also potentiates the tubular D_D064420 of C_D000666. This study was designed to assess the ability of C_D013148 to reduce C_D011188 requirements and to prevent D_D007008 in D_D009503 patients on C_D000666 treatment. METHODS: In this study 26 patients with various D_D006402 were randomized to receive either intravenous C_D000666 alone or C_D000666 and oral C_D013148 100 mg twice daily when developing a proven or suspected D_D009181. RESULTS: Patients receiving concomitant C_D000666 and C_D013148 had significantly higher plasma C_D011188 levels than those receiving C_D000666 alone (P = 0.0027). Those patients receiving C_D000666 and C_D013148 required significantly less C_D011188 supplementation to maintain their plasma C_D011188 within the normal range (P = 0.022). Moreover, urinary C_D011188 losses were significantly less in patients receiving C_D000666 and C_D013148 than those receiving C_D000666 alone (P = 0.040). CONCLUSION: This study showed that C_D013148 can reduce C_D011188 requirements and prevent D_D007008 by reducing urinary C_D011188 loss in D_D009503 patients on C_D000666 treatment.

title:C_D004298 D2 receptor signaling controls neuronal cell death induced by muscarinic and C_D018698rgic drugs.
abstract:C_D004298 (C_D004298), through D1/D2 receptor-mediated signaling, plays a major role in the control of D_D004827 arising in the limbic system. D_-1 leading to neuronal cell death in the affected areas is a major consequence of D_D012640 at the cellular level. In this respect, little is known about the role of C_D004298 receptors in the occurrence of D_D004827-induced neuronal cell death. Here we analyze the occurrence of D_D012640 and D_D020258 in D2R -/- mice treated with the cholinergic agonist C_D010862. We compared these results with those previously obtained with C_D007608 (C_D007608), a potent C_D018698 agonist. Importantly, D2R -/- mice develop D_D012640 at doses of both drugs that are not epileptogenic for WT littermates and show greater D_D020258. However, C_D010862-induced D_D012640 result in a more widespread neuronal death in both WT and D2R -/- brains in comparison to C_D007608. Thus, the absence of D2R lowers the threshold for D_D012640 induced by both C_D018698 and C_D000109. Moreover, the dopaminergic control of D_D004827-induced D_D019636 seems to be mediated by distinct interactions of D2R signaling with these two neurotransmitters.

title:Treatment of C_D018967-induced D_D006966 with a C_D004298 agonist in children.
abstract:BACKGROUND: C_D018967, a potent antagonist of both serotonergic (5HT2A) and C_D004298rgic D2 receptors is associated with D_D006966 in adults and children. Chronically elevated prolactin levels in children with D_D015175 may be associated with arrested growth and development resulting in either D_D011628 or short stature. These possibilities stress the importance of developing a safe and effective approach to drug-induced D_D006966 in youth. We report the successful treatment of C_D018967-induced D_D006966 with C_C047047 in youth. METHODS: We undertook a retrospective case review of four children with C_D018967-induced D_D006966 treated with C_C047047. RESULTS: Four males (age 6-11 years) with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of D_D001523 (fourth edition) D_D001714 or D_D011605, with C_D018967-induced elevations in serum prolactin levels (57.5-129 ng/mL, normal 5-15 ng/mL), were treated with C_C047047 (mean dose 2.13 +/- 0.09 mg/week). When serum prolactin levels normalized in all four subjects (mean 11.2 +/- 10.9 ng/mL), the C_C047047 dose was reduced to 1 mg/week in three of four subjects. The mean duration of therapy with C_C047047 was 523.5 +/- 129.7 days, and the mean duration of therapy with C_D018967 was 788.5 +/- 162.5 days. C_C047047 was well tolerated without adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: C_C047047 may be useful for the treatment of C_D018967-induced D_D006966 in youth; however, further research is needed.

title:D_D041781 associated with the use of C_D008687.
abstract:We report a patient who developed D_D041781 shortly after initiation of treatment with C_D008687 hydrochloride. Ultrasound of the liver and abdominal CT were normal. An ERCP showed normal biliary anatomy. A percutaneous liver biopsy was obtained showing marked D_D002779, with portal D_D004487, ductular proliferation, and acute D_D007249. C_D008687 was discontinued, and the patient's D_D007565 resolved slowly over a period of several months. Given the onset of his D_D007565 2 wk after the initiation of C_D008687, we believe that this case represents an example of C_D008687-associated D_D056486, the first such case reported.

title:Electro-oculography, electroretinography, visual evoked potentials, and multifocal electroretinography in patients with C_D020888-attributed D_D014786.
abstract:PURPOSE: Symptomatic D_D014786 thought to be associated with C_D020888 has been reported. The current study investigated the visual fields and visual electrophysiology of eight patients with known C_D020888-attributed D_D014786, three of whom were reported previously. Six of the patients were no longer receiving C_D020888. METHODS: The central and peripheral fields were examined with the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer. Full visual electrophysiology, including flash electroretinography (ERG), pattern electroretinography, multifocal ERG using the VERIS system, electro-oculography, and flash and pattern visual evoked potentials, was undertaken. RESULTS: Seven patients showed marked D_D014786 with some sparing of the temporal visual field. The eighth exhibited concentric constriction. Most electrophysiological responses were usually just within normal limits; two patients had subnormal Arden electro-oculography indices; and one patient showed an abnormally delayed photopic b wave. However, five patients showed delayed 30-Hz flicker b waves, and seven patients showed delayed oscillatory potentials. Multifocal ERG showed abnormalities that sometimes correlated with the visual field appearance and confirmed that the deficit occurs at the retinal level. CONCLUSION: Marked D_D014786 appears to be associated with C_D020888 therapy. The field defects and some electrophysiological abnormalities persist when C_D020888 therapy is withdrawn.

title:Conversion to C_D020123 immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients: report of an initial experience.
abstract:BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of C_D020123 conversion in patients undergoing C_D016572 (C_D016572) or C_D016559 (C_D016559) D_D064420. METHODS: Twenty renal transplant recipients were switched to fixed dose C_D020123 (C_D020123) (5 mg/day) 0 to 204 months posttransplant. Drug monitoring was not initially used to adjust doses. The indications for switch were chronic C_D016572 or C_D016559 nephroD_D064420 (12), acute C_D016572 or C_D016559 D_D064420 (3), severe D_-1 (2), D_D008232 (D_D008232) in remission (2), and hepatoD_D064420 in 1. Follow-up is 7 to 24 months. RESULTS: In the 12 patients switched because of chronic nephroD_D064420 there was a significant decrease in serum C_D003404 [233+/-34 to 210+/-56 micromol/liter (P<0.05) at 6 months]. D_-1 improved in two patients. No relapse of D_D008232 was observed. Five patients developed D_D011014 (two Pneumocystis carinii D_D011014, one D_D007244 with polyclonal D_D008232 lung infiltrate) and two had D_D001989. There were no deaths. C_D020123 was discontinued in four patients, because of D_D011014 in two, D_D008232 in one, and oral D_D013281 in one. C_D020123 levels were high (>15 ng/ml) in 7 of 13 (54%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: C_D020123 conversion provides adequate immunosuppression to enable C_D016572 withdrawal. However, when converting patients to C_D020123 drug levels should be monitored to avoid over-immunosuppression and adequate antiviral and Pneumocystis carinii D_D011014 prophylaxis should be given.

title:Worsening of C_D007980-induced D_D004409 by motor and mental tasks.
abstract:Ten patients who had D_D010300 with disabling D_D004409 were included in this study to evaluate the role of mental (mental calculation) and motor (flexion/extension of right fingers, flexion/extension of left fingers, flexion/extension of the neck, speaking aloud) tasks on the worsening of peak-dose D_D004409 following administration of an effective single dose of C_D001058. Compared with the score at rest (1.3+/-0.3), a significant aggravation of the D_D004409 score was observed during speaking aloud (5.2+/-1.1, p<0.05), movements of right (4.5+/-1.0, p<0.05) and left (3.7+/-0.8, p<0.05) fingers, movements of the neck (5.1+/-1.0, p<0.05), and mental calculation (3.1+/-1.0, p<0.05). These results suggest that activation tasks such as "speaking aloud" could be used for objective assessment of D_D004409 severity.

title:D_D028361 in C_D004317-induced D_D009202 in mice: suppression of cytochrome c oxidase II gene expression.
abstract:The use of C_D004317 (C_D004317) in D_D009369 chemotherapy has been limited due to its cumulative D_D002318. Earlier observations that C_D004317 interacts with mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and suppresses its enzyme activity led us to investigate C_D004317's action on the cardiovascular functions and heart mitochondrial morphology in Balb-c mice i.p. treated with C_D004317 for several weeks. At various times during treatment, the animals were assessed for cardiovascular functions by electrocardiography and for heart tissue damage by electron microscopy. In parallel, total RNA was extracted from samples of dissected heart and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization to determine the steady-state level of three RNA transcripts encoded by the COXII, COXIII, and COXIV genes. Similarly, samples obtained from the liver of the same animals were analyzed for comparative studies. Our results indicated that 1) treatment of mice with C_D004317 caused D_D001145 characterized by D_D001919, extension of ventricular depolarization time (tQRS), and failure of QRS at high concentrations (10-14 mg/kg body weight cumulative dose); 2) the heart mitochondria underwent D_D004487, fusion, dissolution, and/or disruption of mitochondrial cristae after several weeks of treatment. Such abnormalities were not observed in the mitochondria of liver tissue; and 3) among the three genes of COX enzyme examined, only COXII gene expression was suppressed by C_D004317 treatment, mainly after 8 weeks in both heart and liver. Knowing that heart mitochondria represent almost 40% of heart muscle by weight, we conclude that the deteriorating effects of C_D004317 on cardiovascular function involve D_D028361.

title:Enhanced D_D001919 induced by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in rats pretreated with C_D007538.
abstract:High doses of C_D007538 increase D_D007022 induced by vasodilators and change the accompanying reflex D_D013610 to D_D001919, an interaction attributed to decreased synthesis of brain C_D005680 (C_D005680). In the present study, the possible enhancement by C_D007538 of D_D001919 induced by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was determined in rats anaesthetised with C_D002698-C_D014520. C_D007538 significantly increased D_D001919 after C_D011433, C_D010869, C_D007741 and C_D001262, as well as after C_D003000, but not after C_D018738 or C_D002217. Enhancement was not observed in rats pretreated with C_C006649 or previously vagotomised. These results are compatible with interference by C_D007538 with C_D005680ergic inhibition of cardiac parasympathetic tone. Such interference could be exerted centrally, possibly at the nucleus ambiguus, or peripherally at the sinus node.

title:Epileptogenic activity of C_D005492 after drug induces D_D008180 (C_D005492 and D_D004827)
abstract:OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of C_D005492-containing multivitamin supplementation in D_D004827 women before and during pregnancy in order to determine the rate of structural D_D000014 and D_D004827-related side effects. STUDY DESIGN: First a randomised trial, later periconception care including in total 12225 females. RESULTS: Of 60 D_D004827 women with periconceptional C_D005492 (0.8 mg)-containing multivitamin supplementation, no one developed D_D004827-related side effects during the periconception period. One D_D004827 woman delivered a newborn with cleft lip and palate. Another patient exhibited with a cluster of D_D012640 after the periconception period using another multivitamin. This 22-year-old D_D004827 woman was treated continuously by C_D002220 and a C_D005492 (1 mg)-containing multivitamin from the 20th week of gestation. She developed status D_D004827us and later symptoms of D_D008180. Her pregnancy ended with D_D050497. CONCLUSIONS: The D_D004827 pregnant patient's D_D001327 (probably drug-induced D_D008180) could damage the blood-brain barrier, therefore the therapeutic dose (> or =1 mg) of C_D005492 triggered a cluster of D_D012640. Physiological dose (<1 mg) of C_D005492 both in healthy and 60 D_D004827 women, all without any D_D001327, did not increase the risk for D_D004827 D_D012640.

title:Effects of C_D020117 on symptoms and postcibal small-bowel motor function in patients with D_D043183.
abstract:BACKGROUND: D_D043183 is a common cause of D_D015746 and discomfort and may be related to D_D005767. Our aim was to assess the effects of long-term treatment with a prokinetic agent, C_D020117, on postprandial jejunal motility and symptoms in the D_D043183 (D_D043183). METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with D_D043183 (D_D003248-predominant, n = 17; D_D003967-predominant, n = 21) underwent 24-h ambulatory jejunal manometry before and after 12 week's treatment [C_D020117, 5 mg three times daily (n = 19) or placebo (n = 19)]. RESULTS: In D_D003967-predominant patients significant differences in contraction characteristics were observed between the C_D020117 and placebo groups. In C_D020117-treated D_D003967-predominant patients the mean contraction amplitude was higher (29.3 +/- 3.2 versus 24.9 +/- 2.6 mm Hg, C_D020117 versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 25.7 +/- 6.0 mm Hg), the mean contraction duration longer (3.4 +/- 0.2 versus 3.0 +/- 0.2 sec, C_D020117 versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 3.1 +/- 0.5 sec), and the mean contraction frequency lower (2.0 +/- 0.2 versus 2.5 +/- 0.4 cont./min, C_D020117 versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 2.5 +/- 1.1 cont./min] than patients treated with placebo. No significant differences in jejunal motility were found in the D_D003248-predominant D_D043183 group. Symptoms were assessed by using a visual analogue scale before and after treatment. Symptom scores relating to the severity of D_D003248 were lower in C_D020117-treated D_D003248-predominant D_D043183 patients [score, 54 +/- 5 versus 67 +/- 14 mm, C_D020117 versus placebo (P < 0.05); pretreatment, 62 +/- 19 mm]. D_D003967-predominant D_D043183 patients had a higher D_D010146 score after C_D020117 therapy [score, 55 +/- 15 versus 34 +/- 12 mm, C_D020117 versus placebo (P < 0.05); pretreatment, 67 +/- 19 mm]. CONCLUSION: C_D020117 affects jejunal contraction characteristics and some symptoms in D_D043183.

title:C_D017291-induced D_D017180.
abstract:C_D017291 is a relatively new C_D018942 antibiotic that offers twice-daily dosing. It differs from C_D004917 only in the methylation of the hydroxyl group at position 6. Although the side-effect profile of C_D004917 is established, including D_D005759 and interactions with other drugs subject to hepatic mixed-function oxidase metabolism, experience with the newer C_D018942s is still being recorded. D_D066126 has been demonstrated after both intravenous and oral administration of C_D004917 but has never been reported with the newer C_D018942s. We report a case of D_D001145 that occurred after six therapeutic doses of C_D017291. The D_D001145 resolved after discontinuation of the drug.

title:Persistent D_D018500 following C_D008094 therapy.
abstract:We report the case of a patient who developed severe hypernatraemic D_D003681 following a D_D006259. Ten years previously he had been diagnosed to have C_D008094-induced D_D018500, and C_D008094 therapy had been discontinued. He remained thirsty and D_D011141 despite cessation of C_D008094 and investigations on admission showed him to have normal osmoregulated thirst and C_D014667 secretion, with clear evidence of D_D018500. C_D008094 induced D_D018500 is considered to be reversible on cessation of therapy but D_D011141 persisted in this patient for ten years after C_D008094 was stopped. We discuss the possible renal mechanisms and the implications for management of patients with C_D008094-induced D_D018500.

title:Late D_D066126 after treatment for a malignant D_D001859.
abstract:Cardiac function was assessed in long-term survivors of malignant D_D001859s who were treated according to C_C053519, both including C_D004317. Thirty-one patients, age 10-45 years (median age 17.8 years) were evaluated 2.3-14.1 years (median 8.9 years) following completion of treatment. Cumulative doses of C_D004317 were 225-550 mg/m2 (median dose 360). The evaluation consisted of a history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), signal averaged ECG, 24-hour ambulatory ECG, echocardiography and radionuclide angiography. Eighteen of 31 (58%) patients showed D_D066126, defined as having one or more of the following abnormalities: late potentials, complex D_D001145, left D_D002311, decreased shortening fraction, or decreased ejection fraction. The incidence of D_D006331 increased with length of follow-up (P< or = .05). No correlation could be demonstrated between cumulative dose of C_D004317 and cardiac status, except for heart rate variability. When adjusted to body surface area, the left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPW index) was decreased in all patients. The incidence of C_D004317-induced D_D066126 is high and increases with follow-up, irrespective of cumulative dose. Life-long cardiac follow-up in these patients is warranted. The results of our study suggest that heart rate variability and LVPW index could be sensitive indicators for D_D066126.

title:D_D014652 of C_D008874 versus C_D003975.
abstract:Although some studies have suggested fewer D_D014652 are associated with C_D008874 than with C_D003975 for endoscopic procedures, this variable has not been well documented. We prospectively evaluated the incidence of D_D014652 after intravenous injection of C_D003975 or C_D008874 in 122 consecutive patients undergoing colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Overall, D_D014652 were more frequent with C_D003975 (22 of 62 patients) than with C_D008874 (4 of 60 patients) (p < 0.001). A palpable venous cord was present in 23% (14 of 62) of patients in the C_D003975 group, compared with 2% (1 of 60 patients) in the C_D008874 group (p < 0.002). D_D010146 at the injection site occurred in 35% (22 of 62) of patients in the C_D003975 group compared with 7% (4 of 60 patients) in the C_D008874 group (p < 0.001). D_D004487 and warmth at the injection site were not significantly different between the two groups. Smoking, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, intravenous catheter site, dwell time of the needle, C_D000431 use, and D_D010146 during the injection had no effect on the incidence of D_D014652.

title:D_D013746 and D_D012206 due to surreptitious C_D005665--importance of C_D008274 supplementation.
abstract:Diuretics may induce D_D007008, D_D006996 and D_C537153. While severe D_D007008 may cause D_D018908, severe D_C537153 is associated with D_D013035 and D_D013746 which cannot be corrected by C_D011188 and C_D002118 supplementation alone (1,2). Surreptitious diuretic ingestion has been described, mainly in women who are concerned that they are D_D009765 or D_D004487. Symptomatic D_D007008 has been reported in such patients (3-7) and in one case D_D006996 was observed (8), but the effects of C_D008274 depletion were not noted in these patients.

title:Loss of C_D018698 decarboxylase mRNA-containing neurons in the rat dentate gyrus following C_D010862-induced D_D012640.
abstract:In situ hybridization methods were used to determine if C_D018698 decarboxylase (GAD) mRNA-containing neurons within the hilus of the dentate gyrus are vulnerable to D_D012640-induced damage in a model of chronic D_D012640. Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with C_D010862, and the hippocampal formation was studied histologically at 1, 2, 4, and 8 week intervals after C_D010862-induced D_D012640. In situ hybridization histochemistry, using a C_D004076-labeled GAD cRNA probe, demonstrated a substantial decrease in the number of GAD mRNA-containing neurons in the hilus of the dentate gyrus in the C_D010862-treated rats as compared to controls at all time intervals. Additional neuronanatomical studies, including C_C028911 staining, D_D009410 methods, and histochemical localization of glial fibrillary acidic protein, suggested that the decrease in the number of GAD mRNA-containing neurons was related to D_D009410 rather than to a decrease in GAD mRNA levels. The loss of GAD mRNA-containing neurons in the hilus contrasted with the relative preservation of labeled putative basket cells along the inner margin of the granule cell layer. Quantitative analyses of labeled neurons in three regions of the dentate gyrus in the 1 and 2 week groups showed statistically significant decreases in the mean number of GAD mRNA-containing neurons in the hilus of both groups of experimental animals. No significant differences were found in the molecular layer or the granule cell layer, which included labeled neurons along the lower margin of the granule cell layer. The results indicate that, in this model, a subpopulation of GAD mRNA-containing neurons within the dentate gyrus is selectively vulnerable to D_D012640-induced damage. Such differential vulnerability appears to be another indication of the heterogeneity of C_D005680 neurons.

title:Protective effect of C_D016595 on C_D007213 induced D_D007674 in elderly patients.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the possible protective effects of C_D016595 on renal function in hospitalized elderly patients treated with C_D007213. METHODS: Forty-five hospitalized elderly patients (> 65 years old) who required therapy with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) were randomly assigned to receive either C_D007213, 150 mg/day (Group A), or C_D007213 150 mg/day plus C_D016595 at 0.6 mg/day (Group B). Laboratory variables of renal function [serum C_D003404, C_D001806 (C_D001806) and electrolytes] were evaluated before initiation of therapy and every 2 days, until termination of the study (a period of at least 6 days). Response to treatment was estimated by the visual analog scale for severity of D_D010146. RESULTS: Forty-two patients completed the study, 22 in Group A and 20 in Group B. C_D001806 and C_D003404 increased by > 50% of baseline levels in 54 and 45% of Group A patients, respectively, compared to only 20 and 10% of Group B patients (p < 0.05). C_D011188 (C_D011188) increment of 0.6 mEq/l or more was observed in 50% of Group A, but in only 15% of Group B patients (p < 0.05). The mean increments in C_D001806, C_D003404, and C_D011188 were reduced by 63, 80, and 42%, respectively, in Group B patients compared to Group A. Response to treatment did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Hospitalized elderly patients are at risk for developing C_D007213 related D_D007674. Addition of C_D016595 can minimize this D_D007674 without affecting D_D010146 control.

title:D_D007674 effects of C_D000617 treatment on renal protein reabsorption and accumulation.
abstract:To quantify the effects of C_D005839, C_D007612 and C_D009428 on renal protein reabsorption and accumulation, these drugs were administered to rats intraperitoneally (30 mg/kg/day) for 7, 14 or 21 days. Scanning electron microscopy of the glomerular endothelia, urinary measurements of C_D012964, C_D011188, endogenous lysozyme, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) as well as clearance and accumulation experiments after i.v. administration of egg-white lysozyme and measurements of inulin clearance (GFR) were done in each treatment group. C_D005839 administration decreased diameter, density and shape of endothelial fenestrae. C_D007612 and C_D009428 appeared to have no effect at the dose used. All three C_D000617s decreased GFR and increased urinary excretion of C_D012964 and C_D011188. While C_D005839 and C_D007612 decreased the percentage reabsorption and accumulation of lysozyme after i.v. administration of egg-white lysozyme C_D009428 had no effect. Daily excretion of total protein, endogenous lysozyme and NAG increased only after treatment with C_D007612 and C_D005839. Thus, C_D000617s may act as nephrotoxicants at glomerular and/or tubular level inducing D_D007674 and accumulation of proteins.

title:Reversal of C_D000641 D_D003128 in rats by C_D007980: a peripheral effect.
abstract:C_D000641 D_D003128 was produced in rats within 10 to 15 minutes of an intraperitonealinjection of 1.7 mmol C_D000643. This D_D003128 was prevented with 1.68 mmol C_D007980 given by gastric intubation 15 minutes before the C_D064751 injection. The effect of C_D007980 was correlated with a decrease in blood and brain C_D000641, an increase in brain C_D004298, and an increase in renal excretion of C_D000641 and C_D014508. Intraventricular infusion of C_D004298 sufficient to raise the brain C_D004298 to the same extent did not prevent the C_D000641 D_D003128 nor affect the blood and brain C_D000641 concentrations. Bilateral nephrectomy eliminated the beneficial effect of C_D007980 on blood and brain C_D000641 and the C_D000641 D_D003128 was not prevented. Thus, the reduction in blood and brain C_D000641 and the prevention of C_D000641 D_D003128 after C_D007980, can be accounted for by the peripheral effect of C_D004298 on renal function rather than its central action. These results provide a reasonable explanation for the beneficial effects observed in some D_D001927 patients receiving C_D007980.

title:C_D006493-induced D_D013921 after liver transplantation.
abstract:BACKGROUND: C_D006493 (C_D006493) or C_D006495 (LMWH) is used in anticoagulant protocols at several institutions to prevent D_D013927 after liver transplantation. C_D006493-induced D_D013921 (D_D013921) is an adverse immune-mediated reaction to C_D006493, resulting in platelet count decreases of more than 50%. The frequencies of D_D013921 after liver transplantation and platelet factor 4/C_D006493-reactive antibody (D_D013921 antibody) positivity in liver transplantation patients, however, are unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The 32 men and 20 women underwent living donor liver transplantation. We started LMWH (25 IU/kg/h) on postoperative day (POD) 1, switching to C_D006493 (5000 U/d) on POD 2 or 3. The dose of C_D006493 was changed according to the activated clotting time level. D_D013921 antibody levels were measured the day before surgery and on POD 7 and 14. Platelet count was measured daily for 3 weeks. RESULTS: The average platelet counts preoperatively, and on POD 7, 14, and 21 were 65, 88, 149, and 169 x 10(9)/L, respectively. Two patients developed hepatic artery D_D013927 on POD 11 and 19, respectively, although they were D_D013921 antibody-negative and their platelet counts were stable. In 2 other patients, the platelet count decreased suddenly from 107 x 10(9)/L on POD 4 to 65 x 10(9)/L on POD 6 and from 76 x 10(9)/L on POD 7 to 33 x 10(9)/L on POD 9, respectively. The C_D006493-induced D_D001791 test was negative in these patients. The percentage of D_D013921 antibody-positive patients was 0.5% preoperatively, 5.6% on POD 7, and 5.6% on POD 14. None of the subjects/patients developed C_D006493-related D_D013921. CONCLUSIONS: In our series, the occurrence of D_D013921 after liver transplantation was uncommon.

title:C_D011441-associated D_D014657 in a girl with D_D014424 and D_D006111.
abstract:Palpable D_D011693 is a concerning clinical finding in pediatric patients and can have many causes, including infectious and autoimmune processes. A rare cause, drug-induced D_D014657, may result from the production of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) in response to a medication. We report a girl with D_D014424 and D_D006111 who presented with palpable D_D011693. The diagnosis of C_D011441 (C_D011441)-associated D_D014657 was made by observation of consistent clinical features, the detection of elevated ANA and ANCA in the blood, and the observed clinical resolution of symptoms following withdrawal of C_D011441. Subsequent treatment of persistent D_D006980 with radioablation did not result in an exacerbation of the D_D014657, a complication described in prior case reports.

title:C_D013390-induced D_D014313 during bronchoscopic removal of a tracheal foreign body.
abstract:D_D014313 during general anesthesia is considered an early warning sign of a possible episode of D_D008305. The decision whether to continue or discontinue the procedure depends on the urgency of the surgery and severity of D_D014313. Here, we describe a case of severe D_D014313 (D_D014313) after C_D013390 (C_D013390) administration during general anesthetic management for rigid bronchoscopic removal of a tracheal foreign body. Anesthesia was continued uneventfully with C_D015742 infusion while all facilities were available to detect and treat D_D008305.

title:Minor D_D009422, cognitive development, and somatic development at the age of 3 to 7 years after C_D003907 treatment in very-low birth-weight infants.
abstract:The objective of this study was to assess minor D_D009422, cognitive development, and somatic development after C_D003907 therapy in very-low-birthweight infants. Thirty-three children after C_D003907 treatment were matched to 33 children without C_D003907 treatment. Data were assessed at the age of 3-7 years. C_D003907 was started between the 7th and the 28th day of life over 7 days with a total dose of 2.35 mg/kg/day. Exclusion criteria were D_D001237, D_D000014, major surgical interventions, small for gestational age, intraventricular D_D006470 grades III and IV, D_D007969, and severe D_D011596. Each child was examined by a neuropediatrician for minor D_D009422s and tested by a psychologist for cognitive development with a Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children and a Draw-a-Man Test. There were no differences in demographic data, growth, and socio-economic status between the two groups. Fine motor skills and gross motor function were significantly better in the control group (p<0.01). In the Draw-a-Man Test, the control group showed better results (p<0.001). There were no differences in development of speech, social development, and the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children. After C_D003907 treatment, children showed a higher rate of minor D_D009422s. Neurological development was affected even without neurological diagnosis. Further long-term follow-up studies will be necessary to fully evaluate the impact of C_D003907 on neurological and cognitive development.

title:Force overflow and C_D007980-induced D_D004409 in D_D010300.
abstract:We assessed force coordination of the hand in D_D010300 and its relationship to motor complications of C_D007980 therapy, particularly to C_D007980-induced D_D004409 (D_D004409). We studied two groups of D_D010300 patients with (D_D010300 + D_D004409, n = 23) and without C_D007980-induced D_D004409 (D_D010300 - D_D004409, n = 10), and age-matched healthy controls. The motor score of the Unified D_D010300 Rating Scale, a D_D004409 score and force in a grip-lift paradigm were assessed ON and OFF C_D007980. A pathological increase of forces was seen in ON-state in D_D010300 + D_D004409 only. In D_D010300 + D_D004409, the force involved in pressing down the object before lifting was significantly increased by C_D007980 (by 61%, P < 0.05). An overshooting of peak grip force by 51% (P < 0.05) and of static grip force by 45% (P < 0.01) was observed in the ON- compared with the OFF-drug condition. In contrast, no excessive force was found in D_D010300 - D_D004409. Peak grip force in ON-state was 140% (P < 0.05) higher in D_D010300 + D_D004409 than in D_D010300 - D_D004409, while static grip force was increased by 138% (P < 0.01) between groups. Severity of peak-dose D_D004409 was strongly correlated with grip force in ON-state (r = 0.79 with peak force, P < 0.01). No correlation was observed between forces and the motor score as well as with the daily dose of dopaminergic medication. Force excess was only observed in patients with D_D004409 and motor fluctuations. A close relationship was seen between the overshooting of forces and D_D004409 in the ON-drug condition. We postulate that both D_D004409 and grip force excess share common pathophysiological mechanisms related to motor fluctuations.

We report the case of a previously healthy 19-year-old man with no known D_D004342 in whom angioD_D004487 with significant tongue swelling and protrusion developed within 10 minutes of the administration of a single IV dose of C_D004329.

title:C_D017291-associated D_D006212 in a patient with D_D007676 on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
abstract:D_D006212 are a rare event in D_D007676 and not related to D_D014511 per se. Unreported in the literature is D_D006212 occurring in association with the new C_D018942 antibiotic, C_D017291. We describe such a case in a patient with D_D007676 (D_D007676) maintained on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). The combination of a relatively high dose of C_D017291 in face of D_D007676 in a functionally anephric patient, with underlying C_D000535 intoxication, may have facilitated the appearance of this D_D020258 side effect. It is important to understand the pharmacokinetics of medications in face of D_D007676, the possibility of drug interactions, and how these factors should help guide medication therapy in the D_D007676 patient.

title:Acute D_D007674 of C_D004317 (C_D004317)-loaded C_D003487 nanoparticles.
abstract:Acute C_D004317-loaded nanoparticle (C_D004317NP) D_D007674 was explored in both normal rats and rats with experimental D_D005921. In normal rats, 2/6 rats given free C_D004317 (C_D004317) (5 mg/kg) died within one week, whereas all control animals and all rats having received free NP or C_D004317NP survived. A 3 times higher D_D011507 appeared in animals treated with C_D004317NP than in those treated with C_D004317. Free NP did not provoke any D_D011507. Two hr post-injection, C_D004317NP was 2.7 times more concentrated in kidneys than free C_D004317 (p < 0.025). In rats with immune experimental D_D005921, 5/6 rats given C_D004317 died within 7 days, in contrast to animals treated by C_D004317NP, NP, or untreated, which all survived. D_D011507 appeared in all series, but was 2-5 times more intense (p > 0.001) and prolonged after C_D004317 treatment (400-700 mg/day), without significant difference between C_D004317NP and C_D004317. Rats treated by unloaded NP behaved as controls. These results demonstrate that, in these experimental conditions, C_D004317NP killed less animals than free C_D004317, despite of an enhanced D_D007674 of the former. Both effects (better survival and D_D009401) are most probably related to an enhanced capture of C_D004317NP by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, including mesangial cells.

title:Subjective assessment of D_D020018 of patients on long-term administration of C_D004077.
abstract:Various data suggest that male patients who have received C_D004077 on a longterm basis have increased levels of serum C_D004967 and decreased levels of plasma C_D013739 and luteinizing hormone (LH). This study was undertaken to investigate the links between the long-term administration of C_D004077 therapy and sexual behavior, and the effect of C_D004077 on plasma levels of C_D004958, C_D013739, and LH. The patients of the study and control group (without C_D004077) were of similar cardiac functional capacity and age (25-40 years) and were randomly selected from the D_D012214 patients. A subjective assessment of sexual behavior in the study and control groups was carried out, using parameters such as sexual desire, sexual excitement, and frequency of sexual relations. Personal interviews and a questionnaire were also used for the evaluation of sexual behavior. The findings support the reports concerning C_D004077 effect on plasma C_D004958, C_D013739, and LH. The differences in the means were significant. Tests used to evaluate the changes in sexual behavior showed a significant D_D020018, sexual excitement phase (erection), and frequency of sexual relations in the study group.

title:Fatal D_D000741 due to C_D007213--lymphocyte transformation tests in vitro.
abstract:Although C_D007213 has been implicated as a possible cause of D_D000741 on the basis of a few clinical observations, its role has not been definitely established. A case of fatal D_D000741 is described in which no drugs other than C_D000493 and C_D007213 were given. C_D007213 was first given four weeks prior to the onset of symptoms. A positive lymphocyte transformation test with C_D007213 in vitro further substantiates the potential role of this drug in causing D_D000741 in a susceptible patient. Fortunately, this seems to be a very rare complication.

title:Plasma and urinary lipids and lipoproteins during the development of D_D009404 induced in the rat by C_D011692.
abstract:This study was undertaken to ascertain whether the alterations of plasma lipoproteins found in D_D009404 induced by C_D011692 were due to D_D009404 per se, or, at least in part, to the C_D011692. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the changes in plasma and urinary lipoproteins during the administration of C_D011692 (20 mg/kg for 7 days) and the subsequent development of D_D009404. Since massive D_D000419 occurred after 6 days of treatment, the time-course study was divided into two stages: pre-D_D009404 stage (day 1-5) and D_D009404 stage (day 6-11). In pre-D_D009404 stage the plasma level of C_D005227, C_D014280 and VLDL decreased while that of phospholipid, C_D002788 and HDL remained constant. Plasma apolipoprotein A-I tended to increase (40% increase at day 5). At the beginning of D_D009404 stage (day 6) the concentration of plasma albumin dropped to a very low level, while that of apolipoprotein A-I increased abruptly (4-fold increase) and continued to rise, although less steeply, in the following days. The plasma concentration of HDL followed the same pattern. Plasma VLDL and LDL increased at a later stage (day 9). Plasma apolipoprotein A-I was found not only in HDL (1.063-1.210 g/ml) but also in the LDL density class (1.025-1.050 g/ml). In the pre-D_D009404 stage lipoproteinuria was negligible, while in the early D_D009404 stage the urinary loss of plasma lipoproteins consisted mainly of HDL. These observations indicate that C_D011692 alters plasma lipoproteins by lowering VLDL and increasing HDL. It is likely that the early and striking increase of plasma HDL found in D_D009404 rats is related to a direct effect of the drug on HDL metabolism.

title:Circulating lysosomal enzymes and D_D017114.
abstract:The activities of the lysosomal enzymes acid and neutral protease, N-acetylglucosaminidase, and acid phosphatase were measured in the serum of patients with D_D017114. Acid protease (cathepsin D) activity was increased about tenfold in patients who died and nearly fourfold in those who survived D_D017114 after C_D000082 D_D062787, whereas activities were increased equally in patients with D_D017114 due to D_D006525 whether or not they survived. A correlation was found between serum acid protease activity and prothrombin time, and the increase in cathepsin D activity was sustained over several days compared with C_D001224 aminotransferase, which showed a sharp early peak and then a fall. Circulating lysosomal proteases can damage other organs, and measurement of their activity may therefore be of added value in assessing prognosis in this condition.

title:Transketolase abnormality in C_D014042-induced D_D014899.
abstract:We studied a C_D013831-dependent enzyme, transketolase, from fibroblasts of a D_D003920 patient who developed D_D014899 when treated with C_D014042, in order to delineate if this patient also had transketolase abnormality [high Km for C_D013831 pyrophosphate (C_D013835)], as previously reported in postalcoholic D_D020915. In addition to this patient, we also studied this enzyme from three D_D003920 kindreds without any history of D_D014899 and from four normal controls. We found that the above-mentioned patient and one of the D_D003920 kindreds with no history of D_D014899 had abnormal transketolase as determined by its Km for C_D013835. These data suggest a similarity between postalcoholic D_D020915 and the patient with C_D014042-induced D_D014899 from the standpoint of transketolase abnormality.

title:Mechanisms of D_D017202 induced by C_D004837: comparison with exercise-induced D_D007511.
abstract:The role of C_D004837 in eliciting D_D017202 was examined in patients with D_D003324. Objective signs of D_D007511 and factors increasing myocardial C_D010100 consumption were compared during C_D004837 infusion and supine bicycle exercise. Both C_D004837 and exercise produced D_D017202 as evidenced by ST segment D_D003866 and D_D000787. However, the mechanisms of D_D017202 induced by C_D004837 were significantly different from those of exercise. Exercise-induced D_D017202 was marked predominantly by increased heart rate and rate-pressure product with a minor contribution of end-diastolic volume, while C_D004837-induced D_D007511 was characterized by a marked increase in contractility and a less pronounced increase in heart rate and rate-pressure product. These findings indicate that D_D007511 produced by C_D004837, as may occur during states of emotional distress, has a mechanism distinct from that due to physical exertion.

title:Transient D_D009069 following unilateral D_-1 reflects susceptibility of the nigrostriatal system to exhaustion by C_D000661.
abstract:Following unilateral C_D016627 induced D_-1, a transient period of D_D009069 has been reported to precede the predominant D_D009069. In order to clarify the nature of this initial D_D009069 we examined the effect of the duration of recovery period after the lesion, on C_D000661-induced D_D009069. Three days post lesion, most rats circled predominantly contralaterally to the lesion. Such D_D009069 may result from either degeneration-induced breakdown of the DA pool, or lesion-induced increase of DA turnover in the spared neurons. A substantial degree of contralateral preference was still evident when C_D000661 was administered for the first time 24 days after lesioning, indicating involvement of spared cells in the D_D009069. However, regardless of the duration of recovery (and irrespective of either lesion volume, C_D000661 dose, or post-lesion motor exercise), C_D000661-induced D_D009069 tended to become gradually more ipsilateral as the observation session progressed, and all rats circled ipsilaterally to the lesion in response to further C_D000661 injections. These findings suggest that C_D000661 has an irreversible effect on the post-lesion DA pool contributing to D_D009069.

title:Thyroid function and urine-concentrating ability during C_D008094 treatment.
abstract:It has been suggested that adenylate cyclase inhibition may be important in the development of both D_D018500 and D_D007037 during C_D008094 treatment. We measured serum C_D013974 and urine-concentrating ability (Umax) in response to desmopressin (DDAVP) in 85 patients receiving C_D008094. D_D007037 developed in eight patients while they were taking C_D008094. Impaired Umax was found in both euthyroid and D_D007037 patients while some D_D007037 patients concentrated their urine well. It is concluded that the dominant mechanisms by which C_D008094 exerts these two effects are different.

title:Sensitivity of erythroid progenitor colonies to erythropoietin in C_D015215 treated D_C565469 mice.
abstract:The D_D000740 induced by C_D015215 (C_D015215) is poorly understood. We have used a murine model of D_D000163, D_D007239 of female C57BL/6 mice with LP-BM5 murine D_D007938 (MuLV) virus, to determine if C_D015215-induced D_D000740 is due, in part, to decreased responsiveness of erythropoietic precursors (BFU-e) to erythropoietin (EPO). Mice in the early stage of LP-BM5 MuLV disease were given C_D015215 in their drinking water at 1.0 and 2.5 mg/ml. C_D015215 produced D_D000740 in both groups, in a dose-dependent fashion. Despite the D_D000740, the number of splenic and bone marrow BFU-e in C_D015215 treated mice increased up to five-fold over levels observed in infected untreated animals after 15 d of treatment. Colony formation by splenic and bone marrow BFUe was stimulated at lower concentrations of EPO in mice receiving C_D015215 for 15 d than for infected, untreated mice. By day 30, sensitivity of both splenic and bone marrow BFU-e of treated animals returned to that observed from cells of infected untreated animals. The mean plasma levels of EPO observed in C_D015215 treated mice were appropriate for the degree of D_D000740 observed when compared with C_C030299 (C_C030299) treated mice. The numbers of BFU-e and the percentage of bone marrow erythroblasts observed were comparable in C_D015215 and C_C030299 treated mice with similar degrees of D_D000740. However, D_D045262 was inappropriate for the degree of D_D000740 observed in C_D015215 treated infected mice. C_D015215-induced peripheral D_D000740 in the face of increased numbers of BFU-e and increased levels of plasma EPO suggest a lesion in terminal differentiation.

title:Detection of abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity in C_D004317-induced D_D009202 with C_D019797.
abstract:C_D019797 (C_D019797), an analog of C_D009638 (C_D009638), serves as an index of adrenergic neuron integrity and function. Using a rat model of C_D004317-induced D_D009202, we tested the hypothesis that abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity may appear and be exacerbated dose-dependently in C_D004317 D_D009202. The degree of D_C536522 was analyzed in relation to the duration of C_D004317 treatment (2 mg/kg, once a week). There were no abnormalities or only isolated degeneration in the 1- or 2-wk treatment groups, isolated or scattered degeneration in half of the 3-wk group, frequent scattered degeneration in the 4-wk group, scattered or focal degeneration in the 5-wk group, and extensive degeneration in the 8-wk group. Myocardial accumulation of [125I]C_D019797 4 hr after intravenous injection did not differ between the controls and the groups treated 3 wk or less. However, the 4-wk group had a slightly lower accumulation in the right ventricular wall (82% of the control) and significantly lower accumulation in the left ventricular wall (about 66% of the control: p less than 0.05). In the 5-wk group, C_D019797 accumulation in the right and left ventricular wall was 35% and 27% of that in controls, respectively (p less than 0.001). In the 8-wk group, C_D019797 accumulation in the right and left ventricular wall was 18% and 14% of that in controls, respectively (p less than 0.001). Thus, C_D019797 accumulation in the myocardium decreased in an C_D004317 dose-dependent manner. The appearance of impaired cardiac adrenergic neuron activity in the presence of slight D_D009202 (scattered or focal D_C536522) indicates that C_D019797 scintigraphy may be a useful method for detection of C_D004317-induced D_D009202.

title:D_D000647 associated with C_D011433 D_D064420: a case report.
abstract:An elderly woman developed an D_D000544-like subacute D_D003704 as a result of C_D011433 D_D064420. Analysis of the manifestations showed that severe impairment of memory accounted for virtually all of the abnormalities. There is evidence that cerebral reactions to drug D_D064420 can exhibit patterns that suggest highly selective involvement of functional subdivisions of the brain.

title:Biphasic response of the SA node of the dog heart in vivo to selective administration of C_D007649.
abstract:Effect of C_D007649 on the SA node of the dog heart was studied in vivo using a selective perfusion technique of the SA node artery. Injections of C_D007649 in doses from 100 microgram to 3 mg into the artery produced a D_D003866 of the SA nodal activity by a direct action. This D_D003866 was followed by the sudden appearance of a stimulatory phase. Bilateral vagotomy and sympathectomy or prior administration of a ganglion blocker failed to inhibit the occurrence of the C_D007649-induced D_D013610, while it was completely abolished in the reserpinized dogs or by a prior injection of a beta-blocking agent into the SA node artery. This may indicate that an activation of the peripheral adrenergic mechanism plays an important role in the induction of the excitatory effect of C_D007649 injected in the SA node artery.

title:The use of serum cholinesterase in C_D013390 D_D001049.
abstract:Fifteen patients demonstrating unexpected prolonged D_D001049 lasting several hours after C_D013390 have been treated by a new preparation of human serum cholinesterase. Adequate spontaneous respiration was re-established in an average period of ten minutes after the injection. In 12 patients biochemical genetic examinations confirmed the presence of an atypical serum cholinesterase. In three patients none of the usual variants were found. It is therefore supposed that other unknown variants of serum cholinesterase exist which cannot hydrolyze C_D013390. The use of serum cholinesterase in C_D013390 D_D001049 provided considerable relief to both patient and anaesthetist.

title:D_D007024 occurs following alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockade in chronic C_D011224-pretreated conscious spontaneously D_D006973 rats.
abstract:1. Studies were performed to evaluate whether chronic C_D011224 treatment alters the alpha 2-adrenoceptor function for orthostatic control of arterial blood pressure in conscious spontaneously D_D006973 rats (SHR). 2. Conscious SHR (male 300-350 g) were subjected to 90 degrees head-up tilts for 60 s following acute administration of C_D011224 (0.1 mg kg-1 i.p.) or C_D015016 (3 mg kg-1 i.v.). D_D007024 was determined by the average decrease (%) in mean arterial pressure (MAP femoral) over the 60-s tilt period. The basal MAP of conscious SHR was reduced to a similar extent by C_D011224 (-23%(-)-26% MAP) and C_D015016 (-16%(-)-33% MAP). However, the head-up tilt induced D_D007024 in the SHR treated with C_D011224 (-16% MAP, n = 6), but not in the SHR treated with C_D015016 (less than +2% MAP, n = 6). 3. Conscious SHR were treated for 4 days with C_D011224 at 2 mg kg-1 day-1 i.p. for chronic alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade. MAP in conscious SHR after chronic C_D011224 treatment was 14% lower than in the untreated SHR (n = 8). Head-up tilts in these rats did not produce D_D007024 when performed either prior to or after acute dosing of C_D011224 (0.1 mg kg-1 i.p.). Conversely, administration of C_D015016 (3 mg kg-1 i.v.) in chronic C_D011224 treated SHR decreased the basal MAP by 12-31% (n = 4), and subsequent tilts induced further drops of MAP by 19-23% in these rats. 4. The pressor responses and D_D001919 to the alpha 1-agonist C_C014282 (0.6 and 2 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), the alpha 2-agonist C_C056299 (1 and 3 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), and C_D009638 (0.1 and 1.0 micrograms kg-1 i.v.) were determined in conscious SHR with and without chronic C_D011224 pretreatment. Both the pressor and D_D001919 effects of C_C014282 were abolished in chronic C_D011224 treated SHR (n = 4) as compared to the untreated SHR (n = 4). On the other hand, the pressor effects of C_C056299 were similar in both groups of SHR, but the accompanying D_D001919 was greater in SHR with chronic C_D011224 treatment than without such treatment. Furthermore, the D_D001919 that accompanied the C_D009638-induced pressor effect in SHR was similar with and without chronic C_D011224 treatment despite a 47-71% reduction of the pressor effect in chronic alpha 1-receptor blocked SHR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

title:Coexistence of cerebral venous sinus and internal carotid artery thrombosis associated with exogenous sex hormones. A case report.
abstract:A forty-six year-old premenopausal woman developed D_D006261, D_D009325 and D_D014839, left D_D010291 and D_D012640 two days after parenteral use of C_D011374 and C_D004958. D_D003920 (D_D003920) was found during admission. Computed tomography showed a hemorrhagic infarct in the right frontal lobe and increased density in the superior sagittal sinus (SSS). Left carotid angiography found D_D001157 (ICA). Right carotid angiograms failed to show the SSS and inferior sagittal sinus, suggestive of D_D012851. Coexistence of the cerebral artery and the venous sinus occlusion has been described infrequently. In this case, the authors postulate that the use of C_D004958 and C_D011374 and the underlying D_D003920 increased vascular thrombogenicity, which provided a common denominator for thrombosis of both the ICA and the venous sinus.

title:Systemic D_D064420 and resuscitation in C_D002045-, levoC_D002045-, or C_C037663-infused rats.
abstract:We compared the systemic D_D064420 of C_D002045, levoC_D002045, and C_C037663 in anesthetized rats. We also compared the ability to resuscitate rats after lethal doses of these local anesthetics. C_D002045, levoC_D002045, or C_C037663 was infused at a rate of 2 mg. kg(-1). min(-1) while electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram, and arterial pressure were continuously monitored. When D_D006323 was recorded, drug infusion was stopped and a resuscitation sequence was begun. C_D004837 0.01 mg/kg was administered at 1-min intervals while external cardiac compressions were applied. Resuscitation was considered successful when a systolic arterial pressure > or =100 mm Hg was achieved within 5 min. The cumulative doses of levoC_D002045 and C_C037663 that produced D_D012640 were similar and were larger than those of C_D002045. The cumulative doses of levoC_D002045 that produced D_D001145 and D_D006323 were smaller than the corresponding doses of C_C037663, but they were larger than those of C_D002045. The number of successful resuscitations did not differ among groups. However, a smaller dose of C_D004837 was required in the C_C037663 group than in the other groups. We conclude that the systemic D_D064420 of levoC_D002045 is intermediate between that of C_C037663 and C_D002045 when administered at the same rate and that C_C037663-induced D_D006323 appears to be more susceptible to treatment than that induced by C_D002045 or levoC_D002045.

title:C_C051883 suppresses D_D006962 without inducing D_D001851 in dogs with D_D051437.
abstract:BACKGROUND: C_D002117 therapy suppresses serum levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in patients with D_D051437 but has several drawbacks, including D_D006934 and/or marked D_D001851, which may lead to D_D001851. A new C_D014807 analogue, C_C051883 (C_C051883), has been shown to have promising characteristics. This study was undertaken to determine the effects of C_C051883 on serum PTH levels and bone turnover in states of normal or D_D007674. METHODS: Sixty dogs were either nephrectomized (Nx, N = 38) or sham-operated (Sham, N = 22). The animals received supplemental C_D010710 to enhance PTH secretion. Fourteen weeks after the start of C_D010710 supplementation, half of the Nx and Sham dogs received doses of C_C051883 (three times per week); the other half were given vehicle for 60 weeks. Thereafter, the treatment modalities for a subset of animals were crossed over for an additional eight months. Biochemical and hormonal indices of C_D002118 and bone metabolism were measured throughout the study, and bone biopsies were done at baseline, 60 weeks after C_C051883 or vehicle treatment, and at the end of the crossover period. RESULTS: In Nx dogs, C_C051883 significantly decreased serum PTH levels soon after the induction of D_D051437. In long-standing D_D006962, C_C051883 (0.03 microg/kg) stabilized serum PTH levels during the first months. Serum PTH levels rose thereafter, but the rise was less pronounced compared with baseline than the rise seen in Nx control. These effects were accompanied by episodes of D_D006934 and hyperC_D010710mia. In animals with normal renal function, C_C051883 induced a transient decrease in serum PTH levels at a dose of 0.1 microg/kg, which was not sustained with lowering of the doses. In Nx dogs, C_C051883 reversed abnormal bone formation, such as D_-1 and D_D005355, but did not significantly alter the level of bone turnover. In addition, C_C051883 improved mineralization lag time, (that is, the rate at which osteoid mineralizes) in both Nx and Sham dogs. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that even though C_C051883 does not completely prevent the occurrence of D_D006934 in experimental dogs with D_D051437, it may be of use in the management of D_D006962 because it does not induce D_D001851 and, therefore, does not increase the risk of D_D001851.

title:Chemotherapy of advanced inoperable D_D002289 with C_D017239: a phase II trial.
abstract:C_D017239 (C_D017239; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) has demonstrated significant antineoplastic activity against different D_D009369 types, notably ovarian and breast carcinoma. Two phase II trials of 24-hour C_D017239 infusions in chemotherapy-naive patients with stage IIIB or IV D_D002289 (D_D002289) reported response rates of 21% and 24%. D_D007970 was dose limiting: as many as 62.5% of patients experienced grade 4 D_D007970. We investigated the efficacy and D_D064420 of a 3-hour C_D017239 infusion in a phase II trial in patients with inoperable stage IIIB or IV D_D002289. The 58 patients treated (41 men and 17 women) had a median age of 59 years (age range, 25 to 75) and a performance status of 0 through 2. Most patients (72.4%) had stage IV D_D002289. C_D017239 225 mg/m2 was infused over 3 hours every 3 weeks with standard prophylactic premedication. Of 50 patients evaluable for response, 12 (24%) had partial remission, 26 (52%) had no change, and 12 had disease progression (24%). Hematologic D_D064420 were mild: only one patient (2%) developed grade 3 or 4 D_D009503, while 29% had grade 1 or 2. Grade 1 or 2 D_D011115 affected 56% of patients while only one (2%) experienced severe D_D011115. Similarly, grade 1 or 2 D_D063806/D_D018771 was observed in 63.2% of patients, but only 14.3% experienced grade 3 or 4. D_D009325 and D_D014839 were infrequent, with 14% of patients experiencing grade 1 or 2 and only 2% experiencing grade 3 or 4. C_D017239 is thus an active single agent in this patient population, with a 3-hour infusion proving comparably effective to a 24-hour infusion and superior in terms of the incidence of hematologic and nonhematologic D_D064420. Further phase II studies with C_D017239 combined with other drugs active against D_D002289 are indicated, and phase III studies comparing C_D017239 with standard chemotherapy remain to be completed.

title:D_D002543 associated with C_D010665 in combination with C_D002110.
abstract:C_D010665 (C_D010665) is a drug that has been associated with serious side effects including D_D020521. It is often combined with C_D002110 in diet preparations and "look-alike" pills. In order to determine if C_D010665/C_D002110 can lead to D_D020521 in normotensive and/or D_D006973 rats, we administered the combination in six times the allowed human dose calculated on a per weight basis for the rats two times per day for five days. Subarachnoid and D_D002543 was noted in 18% of the D_D006973 rats. A single C_D010665/C_D002110 administration (same dose) lead to acute D_D006973 in both the normotensive and D_D006973 animals. These results suggest that C_D010665/C_D002110 can lead to D_D002543 in previously D_D006973 animals when administered in greater than the allowed dosage. An acute elevation in blood pressure may be a contributing factor.

title:Long-term efficacy and D_D064420 of high-dose C_D000638 therapy for D_D017180 or D_D014693.
abstract:C_D000638 was administered to 154 patients who had sustained, symptomatic D_D017180 (D_D017180) (n = 118) or a D_D006323 (n = 36) and who were refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs. The loading dose was 800 mg/day for 6 weeks and the maintenance dose was 600 mg/day. Sixty-nine percent of patients continued treatment with C_D000638 and had no recurrence of symptomatic D_D017180 or D_D014693 (D_D014693) over a follow-up of 6 to 52 months (mean +/- standard deviation 14.2 +/- 8.2). Six percent of the patients had a nonfatal recurrence of D_D017180 and were successfully managed by continuing C_D000638 at a higher dose or by the addition of a conventional antiarrhythmic drug. One or more adverse drug reactions occurred in 51% of patients. Adverse effects forced a reduction in the dose of C_D000638 in 41% and discontinuation of C_D000638 in 10% of patients. The most common symptomatic adverse reactions were D_D014202 or D_D001259 (35%), D_D009325 and D_D000855 (8%), D_D014786 (6%), D_D013959 (6%) and D_-1 (5%). Although large-dose C_D000638 is highly effective in the long-term treatment of D_D017180 or D_D014693 refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs, it causes significant D_D064420 in approximately 50% of patients. However, when the dose is adjusted based on clinical response or the development of adverse effects, 75% of patients with D_D017180 or D_D014693 can be successfully managed with C_D000638.

title:Effect of C_D002122 and C_D015761 therapy on C_D003891 D_D064420 in rats.
abstract:BACKGROUND: D_D007022 is a major contributor to mortality in tricyclic antidepressant D_D062787. Recent data suggest that tricyclic antidepressants inhibit C_D002118 influx in some tissues. This study addressed the potential role of C_D002118 channel blockade in tricyclic antidepressant-induced D_D007022. METHODS: Two interventions were studied that have been shown previously to improve blood pressure with C_D002118 channel blocker D_D062787. C_D002122 and C_D015761. Anesthetized rats received the tricyclic antidepressant C_D003891 IP to produce D_D007022, QRS prolongation, and D_D001919. Fifteen min later, animals received C_D002122, C_D017693, or saline. In a second experiment, rats received tricyclic antidepressant C_D003891 IP followed in 15 min by C_D015761 or saline. RESULTS: C_D017693 briefly (5 min) reversed D_D007022 and QRS prolongation. C_D002122 and C_D015761 failed to improve blood pressure. The incidence of D_D001145 (p = 0.004) and D_D012640 (p = 0.03) in the C_D002122 group was higher than the other groups. CONCLUSION: The administration of C_D002122 or C_D015761 did not reverse tricyclic antidepressant-induced D_D007022 in rats. C_D002122 therapy may possibly worsen both cardiovascular and central nervous system D_D064420. These findings do not support a role for C_D002118 channel inhibition in the pathogenesis of tricyclic antidepressant-induced D_D007022.

title:Phase I trial of C_D015474 in children with D_D009447 following bone marrow transplantation.
abstract:PURPOSE: Treatment of D_D009447 cell lines with C_D015474 (C_D015474) can cause sustained inhibition of proliferation. Since C_D015474 has demonstrated clinical responses in D_D009447 patients, it may be effective in preventing relapse after cytotoxic therapy. This phase I trial was designed to determine the maximal-tolerated dosage (MTD), D_D064420, and pharmacokinetics of C_D015474 administered on an intermittent schedule in children with D_D009447 following bone marrow transplantation (BMT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-one assessable patients, 2 to 12 years of age, were treated with oral C_D015474 administered in two equally divided doses daily for 2 weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period, for up to 12 courses. The dose was escalated from 100 to 200 mg/m2/d until dose-limiting D_D064420 (DLT) was observed. A single intrapatient dose escalation was permitted. RESULTS: The MTD of C_D015474 was 160 mg/m2/d. Dose-limiting D_D064420 in six of nine patients at 200 mg/m2/d included D_D006934 (n = 3), D_D005076 (n = 2), and D_D000740/D_D013921/D_D014839/D_D005076 (n = 1). All D_D064420 resolved after C_D015474 was discontinued. Three complete responses were observed in marrow D_D009362. Serum levels of 7.4 +/- 3.0 mumol/L (peak) and 4.0 +/- 2.8 mumol/L (trough) at the MTD were maintained during 14 days of therapy. The DLT correlated with serum levels > or = 10 mumol/L. CONCLUSION: The MTD of C_D015474 given on this intermittent schedule was 160 mg/m2/d. Serum levels known to be effective against D_D009447 in vitro were achieved at this dose. The DLT included D_D006934, and may be predicted by serum C_D015474 levels. Monitoring of serum C_D002118 and C_D015474 levels is indicated in future trials.

title:Effect of C_D002122 on gross behavioural changes produced by C_D002217 and C_D010830 in cats.
abstract:The effect of C_D002122 injected into the cerebral ventricles of group-housed unanaesthetized cats upon vocalization (rage, hissing and snarling), fighting (attack with paws and claws, defense with paws and claws and biting), D_D015878, D_D014202 and D_D004830 produced by C_D002217 and C_D010830 injected similarly was investigated. C_D002122 depressed or almost completely abolished the vocalization and fighting due to C_D002217 and C_D010830. On the other hand, D_D015878, D_D014202 and D_D004830 evoked by C_D002217 and C_D010830 were not significantly changed by C_D002122. It is apparent that C_D002122 can "dissociate" vocalization and fighting from autonomic and motor phenomena such as D_D015878, D_D014202 and D_D004830 caused by C_D002217 and C_D010830. C_D002122 inhibited the vocalization and fighting produced by C_D002217 and C_D010830 most probably by a nonspecific stabilizing action on central muscarinic cholinoceptive sites. These results further support the view that C_D002118 ions in excess have an C_D001285-like action also in the central nervous system.

A patient who had developed all 5 is now described. The D_D012871 resembled D_C536202, which has been reported as a rare side effect in patients with D_D006527 but not in patients with D_D001172 treated with C_D010396.

title:Electrocardiographic changes and D_D001145 in patients receiving psychotropic drugs.
abstract:Eight patients had cardiac manifestations that were life-threatening in five while taking psychotropic drugs, either C_D010640 or tricyclic antidepressants. Although most patients were receiving several drugs, C_D013881 (C_D013881) appeared to be responsible for five cases of D_D017180, one of which was fatal in a 35 year old woman. SupraD_D017180 developed in one patient receiving C_D002746 (C_D002746). C_D009661 (C_D009661) and C_D000639 (C_D000639) each produced D_D002037 in a 73 year old woman. Electrocardiographic T and U wave abnormalities were present in most patients. The D_D001145 responded to intravenous administration of C_D008012 and to direct current electric shock; ventricular pacing was required in some instances and intravenous administration of C_D011433 combined with ventricular pacing in one. The D_D013610 generally subsided within 48 hours after administration of the drugs was stopped. Five of the eight patients were 50 years of age or younger; only one clearly had antecedent D_D006331. Major D_D001145 are a potential hazard in patients without D_D006331 who are receiving customary therapeutic doses of psychotropic drugs. A prospective clinical trial is suggested to quantify the risk of D_D005117 to patients receiving C_D010640 or tricyclic antidepressant drugs.

title:Serotonergic drugs, C_D001569 and C_D001418 block C_D009118-induced D_D009207 in a strain of mice.
abstract:In male Swiss mice, C_D009118 produced D_D009207. A 3 mg/kg (i.p.) dose induced this response in all of the mice tested and the peak response of 73 jerks per min was observed between 27 and 45 min. Increasing the brain C_D012701 levels by the administration of C_D006916 (80-160 mg/kg) in combination with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor resulted in an inhibition of the C_D009118 effect. However, in a similar experiment C_D007980 (80-160 mg/kg) was without effect. In doses of 3-10 mg/kg, the C_D012701 receptor agonist C_C014896 caused a dose-dependent blockade of the response of C_D009118. Of the C_D001569, C_D002998 (0.1-0.3 mg/kg) was found to be several fold more potent than C_D003975 (0.3-3 mg/kg) in blocking the D_D009207. While (-)-C_D001418 (1-3 mg/kg) proved to be an effective antagonist of C_D009118, its (+)-isomer (5-20 mg/kg) lacked this property. Considering the fact that C_D006916 and the C_D001569 have been found to be beneficial in the management of clinical D_D009207, the C_D009118-induced D_D009207 seems to be a satisfactory animal model that may prove useful for the development of new drug treatments for this condition. Our present study indicated the possible value of C_C014896 and (-)-C_D001418 in the management of clinical D_D009207.

abstract:This paper presents the clinical and metabolic findings in two young boys with long-standing D_D007625. Following short exposure to oral C_D011241, both boys developed D_D053609, increasing D_D006970, D_D059606, D_D006963, and D_D011141. Both presented in the emergency room with profound D_D003128, D_D007022, severe D_D006943, and D_D000138. Nonketotic lactic D_D000138 was present in one and D_D007662 without a known serum C_D019344 level was present in the other. D_D012131 rapidly ensued and both patients expired in spite of efforts at resuscitation. We believe these two cases represent a newly described and catastrophic D_-1 in the D_D007625.

title:Effects of active constituents of Crocus sativus L., C_C029036 on C_D013311-induced model of sporadic D_D000544 in male rats.
abstract:BACKGROUND: The involvement of water-soluble C_D002338, C_C029036s, as the main and active components of Crocus sativus L. extract in learning and memory processes has been proposed. In the present study, the effect of C_C029036s on sporadic D_D000544 induced by intracerebroventricular (icv) C_D013311 (C_D013311) in male rats was investigated. METHODS: Male adult Wistar rats (n = 90 and 260-290 g) were divided into 1, control; 2 and 3, C_C029036s (15 and 30 mg/kg); 4, C_D013311; 5 and 6, C_D013311 + C_C029036s (15 and 30 mg/kg) groups. In D_D000544 groups, rats were injected with C_D013311-icv bilaterally (3 mg/kg) in first day and 3 days later, a similar C_D013311-icv application was repeated. In C_D013311 + C_C029036 animal groups, C_C029036 was applied in doses of 15 and 30 mg/kg, i.p., one day pre-surgery and continued for three weeks. Prescription of C_C029036 in each dose was repeated once for two days. However, the learning and memory performance was assessed using passive avoidance paradigm, and for spatial cognition evaluation, Y-maze task was used. RESULTS: It was found out that C_C029036 (30 mg/kg)-treated C_D013311-injected rats show higher correct choices and lower errors in Y-maze than vehicle-treated C_D013311-injected rats. In addition, C_C029036 in the mentioned dose could significantly attenuated learning and memory impairment in treated C_D013311-injected group in passive avoidance test. CONCLUSION: Therefore, these results demonstrate the effectiveness of C_C029036 (30 mg/kg) in antagonizing the D_D003072 caused by C_D013311-icv in rats and its potential in the treatment of D_D019636 such as D_D000544.

Skin biopsy specimens showed D_D013684 and noncaseating epithelioid granulomatous tissue formation in the papillary to mid dermis. Continuous topical use of immunomodulators such as C_D016559 or C_C117268 should be regarded as a potential cause of rosaceiform D_D003872, although many cases have not been reported.

title:A novel animal model to evaluate the ability of a drug delivery system to promote the passage through the BBB.
abstract:The purpose of this investigation was to explore the potentiality of a novel animal model to be used for the in vivo evaluation of the ability of a drug delivery system to promote the passage through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and/or to improve the brain localization of a bioactive compound. A Tween 80-coated C_-1 nanoparticles was used as a model of colloidal drug delivery system, able to trespass the BBB. C_D013619, administered in C_D018021 pre-treated rats, induces electrocorticographic D_D012640 and delayed D_D001930. The toxic effects of C_D013619-loaded C_-1 nanoparticles (5mg/kg), a saline solution of C_D013619 (5mg/kg) and an empty colloidal nanoparticle suspension were compared following i.p. administration in C_D018021-pre-treated Wistar rats. All the animals treated with C_D013619-loaded nanoparticles showed an earlier outcome of CNS adverse symptoms, i.e. D_D004827 onset, with respect to those animals treated with the free compound (10 min vs. 22 min respectively). In addition, C_D013619-loaded nanoparticles administration induced D_D001930 in CA1 field of the hippocampus in all treated animals, while the saline solution of C_D013619 only in 60% of animals. Empty nanoparticles provided similar results to control (saline-treated) group of animals. In conclusion, the evaluation of time-to-onset of symptoms and the severity of neurodegenerative processes induced by the C_D013619-C_D008094 model of D_D004827 in the rat, could be used to evaluate preliminarily the capability of a drug delivery system to trespass (or not) the BBB in vivo.

title:The antiD_D001145 effect and possible ionic mechanisms of C_D010862 on animal models.
abstract:This study was designed to evaluate the effects of C_D010862 and explore the underlying ionic mechanism, using both C_D000157-induced rat and C_D010042-induced guinea pig D_D001145 models. Confocal microscopy was used to measure intracellular free-C_D002118 concentrations ([C_D002118(2+)](i)) in isolated myocytes. The current data showed that C_D010862 significantly delayed onset of D_D001145s, decreased the time course of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, reduced D_D001145 score, and increased the survival time of D_D001145 rats and guinea pigs. [C_D002118(2+)](i) overload induced by C_D000157 or C_D010042 was reduced in isolated myocytes pretreated with C_D010862. Moreover, M(3)-muscarinic C_D000109 receptor (mAChR) antagonist C_C042375 (C_C042375) partially abolished the beneficial effects of C_D010862. These data suggest that C_D010862 produced antiD_D001145 actions on D_D001145 rat and guinea pig models induced by C_D000157 or C_D010042 via stimulating the cardiac M(3)-mAChR. The mechanism may be related to the improvement of C_D002118(2+) handling.

title:C_D004221-induced transient optic and peripheral neuropathy: a case report.
abstract:AIM: To report a case of optic and peripheral neuropathy after chronic use of C_D004221 for D_D000437 management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case report. RESULTS: A 57-year-old male presented with gradual D_D014786 in both eyes with intermittent D_D006261 for 2 months. He also complained of D_D010292 with D_D006987 in both feet. His vision was 6/15 and 2/60 in the right and left eyes, respectively. Fundoscopy revealed bilaterally swollen optic nerve heads. Visual field testing confirmed bilateral central-caecal D_D012607. He had been taking C_D004221 for D_D000437 for the preceding 3 years. C_D004221 discontinuation lead to an immediate symptomatic improvement. CONCLUSION: Physicians initiating long-term C_D004221 therapy should be aware of these adverse effects. They should recommend annual ophthalmic reviews with visual field testing. Patients should be reassured with respect to the reversibility of these adverse effects.

title:Sustained clinical improvement of a patient with decompensated D_D006509 virus-related D_D005355 after treatment with C_D019259 monotherapy.
abstract:D_D006509, which causes liver D_D005355 and D_D006528, remains a major health problem in Asian countries. Recent development of vaccine for prevention is reported to be successful in reducing the size of chronically infected carriers, although the standard medical therapies have not been established up to now. In this report, we encountered a patient with decompensated HBV-related D_D005355 who exhibited the dramatic improvements after antiviral therapy. The patient was a 50-year-old woman. Previous conventional medical treatments were not effective for this patient, thus this patient had been referred to our hospital. However, the administration of C_D019259, a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, for 23 months dramatically improved her liver severity. During this period, no drug resistant mutant HBV emerged, and the serum HBV-DNA level was continuously suppressed. These virological responses were also maintained even after the antiviral therapy was discontinued. Moreover, both D_D006509 surface antigen and e antigen were observed to have disappeared in this patient. The administration of C_D019259 to patients with HBV-related D_D005355, like our present case, should be considered as an initial medical therapeutic option, especially in countries where liver transplantation is not reliably available.

title:Dual effects of C_D008550 on C_C032232-induced D_D053608 in rats.
abstract:C_D008550 affects the circadian sleep/wake cycle, but it is not clear whether it may influence drug-induced D_D053608. C_D013874 was administered intraperitoneally into male rats pre-treated with C_D008550 (0.05, 0.5, 5 and 50 mg/kg). C_D008550 pre-treatment affected in a dual manner C_C032232 D_D053608, however, no dose-effect correlation was found. In particular, low doses reduced the latency to and prolonged the duration of C_C032232 D_D053608. In contrast, the highest dose of C_D008550 (50 mg/kg) caused a paradoxical increase in the latency and produced a sustained reduction of the duration of D_D053608, and a reduction in mortality rate. C_D008550 0.5 and 5 mg/kg influenced the duration but not the latency of C_D007649- or C_D003975-induced D_D053608. Thus, the dual action of C_D008550 on pharmacological D_D053608 seems to be specific for the C_C032232 mechanism of action.

title:Effects of C_C049860 on cholinesterase and C_D012601-induced D_D000647.
abstract:The effects of C_C049860 on cholinesterase, C_D012601-induced D_D000647 and spontaneous movement were examined and compared with those of the well-known cholinesterase inhibitors C_D013619 and C_C076946. C_C049860, C_D013619 and C_C076946 all strongly inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in human red blood cells (IC50s = 1.0 x 10(-6), 2.9 x 10(-7) and 3.7 x 10(-8) M, respectively). In addition, C_C049860 and C_D013619, but not C_C076946, strongly inhibited butyrylcholinestrase (BuChE) in human serum. All three drugs produced mixed inhibition of AChE activity. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of C_C049860 on AChE was reversible. All compounds at 0.1-1 mg/kg p.o. significantly improved the D_D000647 induced by C_D012601 (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) in rats performing a passive avoidance task. The three compounds at 1 and 3 mg/kg p.o. did not significantly decrease spontaneous movement by rats. These findings suggest that C_C049860 at a low dose (0.1-1 mg/kg p.o.) improves C_D012601-induced D_D000647 but does not affect spontaneous movement. The findings suggest that C_C049860 may be a useful drug for the treatment of D_D000544.

This drug was initiated in association with C_D017374 and C_D004308 in a D_-1 patient with chronic D_D010146. Fifty-six days after initiation of the treatment the patient presented D_D006212 that only stopped after the withdrawal of psycho-active drugs and C_D014147.

title:Apparent cure of D_D001172 by bone marrow transplantation.
abstract:We describe the induction of sustained remissions and possible cure of severe erosive D_D001172 (D_D001172) by bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in 2 patients. BMT was used to treat severe D_D000741 which was caused by C_D006046 in one case and C_D010396 in the other. In the 8 and 6 years since the transplants (representing 8 and 4 years since cessation of all immunosuppressive therapy, respectively), the D_D001172 in each case has been completely quiescent. Although short term remission of severe D_D001172 following BMT has been reported, these are the first cases for which prolonged followup has been available. This experience raises the question of the role of BMT itself as a therapeutic option for patients with uncontrolled destructive D_D013585.

title:Urinary enzymes and protein patterns as indicators of D_D007674.
abstract:D_D058186 to the proximal tubular, glomerular, and papillary regions of the rat were produced by administration of C_C001335 (C_C001335), C_D011692 (C_D011692), and C_C004504 (C_C004504), respectively. Several routine indicators of D_D007674, the enzymes alkaline phosphatase and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, and the molecular weight of D_D011507 were determined on urine samples. Tubular damage produced by C_C001335 or C_C004504 was discriminated both quantitatively and qualitatively from D_D007674 produced by C_D011692. The latter was characterized by a pronounced increase in D_D011507, especially proteins with molecular weight greater than 40,000 Da. In contrast, D_D011507 in tubular damage was raised only slightly and characterized by D_D011507 of a wide range of molecular weights. Proximal tubular damage caused by C_C001335 and papillary damage caused by C_C004504 were distinguished both by conventional urinalysis (volume and specific gravity) and by measurement of the two urinary enzymes. Alkaline phosphatase and C_D005947 were markedly and transiently elevated in proximal tubular damage and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase showed a sustained elevation in papillary damage. It is concluded that both selective urinary enzymes and the molecular weight pattern of urinary proteins can be used to provide diagnostic information about the possible site of D_D007674.

title:C_D007069 continuous infusion without C_D015080. A phase I trial of a 14-day cycle.
abstract:Twenty patients received 27 courses of C_D007069 administered as a 24-hour continuous infusion for 14 days without C_D015080. The goal of the study was to deliver a dose rate and total cumulative dose of C_D007069 that would be comparable to standard bolus or short-term infusions administered with C_D015080. Dose escalations proceeded from 200 to 300, 400, 450, 500, and 550 mg/m2/d. Four patients developed transient microscopic D_D006417 at 400, 450, and 500 mg/m2/d. There were no instances of macroscopic D_D006417. At 550 mg/m2/d, three patients experienced nonurologic D_D064420; D_D003221 (1), D_D009325 (1), and Grade 2 D_D007970 (1). The recommended dose of 500 mg/m2/d delivers a total dose of 7 g/m2 per cycle, which is comparable to that delivered in clinical practice for bolus or short-term infusion. Because few patients received multiple courses over time, the cumulative effects are indeterminate in the present trial. The frequency and predictability of D_D006417 are not precise, and at least daily monitoring by urine Hematest is essential, adding C_D015080 to the infusate in patients with persistent D_D006417. The protracted infusion schedule for C_D007069 permits convenient outpatient administration without C_D015080 and reduces the drug cost of clinical usage of this agent by up to  890 per cycle. Clinical activity was demonstrated in a single patient, but a comparative trial of standard bolus schedules with the protracted infusion schedule will be necessary to determine if the clinical effectiveness of the drug is maintained.

title:D_D009203 in pregnancy associated with C_D002996 for ovulation induction: a case report.
abstract:BACKGROUND: C_D002996 (C_D002996) is commonly prescribed for ovulation induction. It is considered safe, with minimal side effects. D_D013923 is a rare but life-threatening complication that has been reported after ovulation induction with C_D002996. Spontaneous D_D003328 or D_D013923 with subsequent clot lysis has been suggested as one of the most common causes of D_D009203 (D_D009203) during pregnancy, with a subsequently normal coronary angiogram. CASE: A 33-year-old woman with a 5-week gestation had recently received C_D002996 for ovulation induction and presented with D_D002637. An electrocardiogram showed a lateral and anterior wall D_D009203. Cardiac enzymes showed a peak rise in troponin I to 9.10 ng/mL. An initial exercise stress test was normal. At the time of admission, the patient was at high risk of D_D011832 to the fetus, so a coronary angiogram was postponed until the second trimester. It showed normal coronary vessels. CONCLUSION: This appears to be the first reported case documenting a possible association between C_D002996 and D_D009203. D_D013927 might be a rare but hazardous complication of C_D002996. Given this life-threatening complication, appropriate prophylactic measures should be used in high-risk woman undergoing ovarian stimulation.

title:D_-1 and D_D002761 related to long-term C_D010634 therapy: an autopsy report of two patients.
abstract:C_D010634 (C_D010634) has a reputation for safety, and it is commonly believed that C_D010634-related increases in serum aminotransferase levels do not indicate or predict the development of significant chronic D_D008107. Here we report of two adult patients with a long history of D_D004827 treated with C_D010634 who died suddenly: one as consequence of D_D006323, the other of acute D_D001996. At autopsy, analysis of liver parenchyma revealed rich portal inflammatory infiltrate, which consisted of mixed eosinophil and monocyte cells, associated with several foci of D_D009336 surrounded by a hard ring of non-specific granulomatous tissue. Inflammatory reactions of internal and external hepatic biliary ducts were also seen. Our findings illustrate that C_D010634 may be associated with chronic D_D008107, which may lead to more serious and deleterious consequences. For this reason, each clinician should recognize this entity in the differential diagnosis of C_D010634-related asymptomatic D_D056487.

title:C_D004977-associated D_D009901.
abstract:INTRODUCTION: C_D004977 is used in the treatment of D_D014376, which is still prevalent in Southeast Asia, and can be associated with permanent D_D014786. We report 3 cases which presented with D_D006423. CLINICAL PICTURE: Three patients with C_D004977-associated toxic D_D009901 are described. All 3 patients had D_D014786. The D_D014786 had a bitemporal flavour, suggesting involvement of the optic chiasm. TREATMENT: Despite stopping C_D004977 on diagnosis, visual function continued to deteriorate for a few months. Subsequent improvement was mild in 2 cases. In the third case, visual acuity and colour vision normalised but the optic discs were pale. OUTCOME: All 3 patients had some permanent D_D014786. CONCLUSIONS: C_D004977 usage is associated with permanent D_D014786 and should be avoided if possible or used with caution and proper ophthalmological follow-up. The author postulates that in cases of C_D004977 associated chiasmopathy, C_D004977 may initially affect the optic nerves and subsequently progress to involve the optic chiasm.

title:Tolerability of C_C012655 and C_D000082 in patients with C_D000894-induced D_D014581/D_D000799.
abstract:Previous studies evaluated the tolerance of C_C012655 and C_D000082 in subjects with cutaneous, respiratory and anaphylactoid reactions induced by C_D000894 (C_D000894s). In this study we investigated tolerability and reliability of C_C012655 and C_D000082 in a very large number of patients with an exclusive well-documented history of C_D000894-induced D_D014581/D_D000799. Furthermore, we evaluated whether some factors have the potential to increase the risk of reaction to C_D000082 and C_C012655. A single-placebo-controlled oral challenge procedure with C_C012655 or C_D000082 was applied to 829 patients with a history of C_D000894-induced D_D014581/D_D000799. A total of 75/829 (9.4%) patients experienced reactions to C_C012655 or C_D000082. Of the 715 patients tested with C_C012655 62 (8.6%) showed a positive test, while of 114 subjects submitted to the challenge with C_D000082, 13 (9.6%) did not tolerate this drug. Furthermore, 18.28% of patients with a history of chronic D_D014581 and 11.8% of subjects with an history of C_D000894-induced D_D014581/D_D000799 or D_D000799 alone (with or without chronic D_D014581) resulted to be intolerant to alternative drugs. Taken together, our results confirm the good tolerability of C_C012655 and C_D000082 in patients who experienced D_D014581/D_D000799 caused by C_D000894s. However, the risk of reaction to these alternative study drugs is statistically increased by a history of chronic D_D014581 and, above all, by a history of C_D000894-induced D_D000799.

title:Effects of C_D014700 on D_D001281 and its electrophysiological determinants in dogs.
abstract:BACKGROUND: D_D013617-induced remodeling promotes the occurrence and maintenance of D_D001281 (D_D001281) and decreases L-type C_D002118(2+) current. There is also a clinical suggestion that acute L-type C_D002118(2) channel blockade can promote D_D001281, consistent with an D_D001281 promoting effect of C_D002118(2+) channel inhibition. METHODS: To evaluate the potential mechanisms of D_D001281 promotion by C_D002118(2+) channel blockers, we administered C_D014700 to C_D009020-C_D002698 anesthetized dogs. C_D004110 was used as a comparison drug and autonomic blockade with C_D001285 and C_D009248 was applied in some experiments. Epicardial mapping with 240 epicardial electrodes was used to evaluate activation during D_D001281. RESULTS: C_D014700 caused D_D001281 promotion in six dogs, increasing mean duration of D_D001281 induced by burst pacing, from 8+/-4 s (mean+/-S.E.) to 95+/-39 s (P<0.01 vs. control) at a loading dose of 0.1 mg/kg and 228+/-101 s (P<0.0005 vs. control) at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg. Underlying electrophysiological mechanisms were studied in detail in five additional dogs under control conditions and in the presence of the higher dose of C_D014700. In these experiments, C_D014700 shortened mean effective refractory period (ERP) from 122+/-5 to 114+/-4 ms (P<0.02) at a cycle length of 300 ms, decreased ERP heterogeneity (from 15+/-1 to 10+/-1%, P<0.05), heterogeneously accelerated atrial conduction and decreased the cycle length of D_D001281 (94+/-4 to 84+/-3 ms, P<0.005). C_D004110 did not affect ERP, D_D001281 cycle length or D_D001281 duration, but produced conduction acceleration similar to that caused by C_D014700 (n=5). In the presence of autonomic blockade, C_D014700 failed to promote D_D001281 and increased, rather than decreasing, refractoriness. Neither C_D014700 nor C_D004110 affected atrial conduction in the presence of autonomic blockade. Epicardial mapping suggested that C_D014700 promoted D_D001281 by increasing the number of simultaneous wavefronts reflected by separate zones of reactivation in each cycle. CONCLUSIONS: C_D014700 promotes D_D001281 in normal dogs by promoting multiple circuit reentry, an effect dependent on intact autonomic tone and not shared by C_D004110.

title:D_D007022, D_D001919, and D_D006323 after high-dose intravenous C_D008775 in a monitored patient.
abstract:We report a case of D_D007022, D_D001919, and D_D006323 after intravenous administration of high-dose C_D008775 in a 73-year-old patient who underwent electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring throughout the episode. There was a history of D_D007511 D_D006331 9 years earlier. The patient was admitted with a D_C538458 with D_D006469, rapidly progressive D_D051437, and D_D000860 that required mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. After receiving advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the patient recovered cardiac rhythm. The ECG showed a junctional rhythm without D_D001145. This study reviews the current proposed mechanisms of D_D003645 after a high dose of intravenous C_D008775 (C_D008775). These mechanisms are not well understood because, in most cases, the patients were not monitored at the moment of the event. Rapid infusion and underlying D_D006331 were important risk factors in the case reported here, and the authors discount D_D001145 as the main mechanism.

title:Lifetime treatment of mice with C_D015215 (C_D015215) produces D_D009190.
abstract:C_D015215 has induced a D_D000748 in D_D000163 patients on long term C_D015215 therapy. It is generally assumed that DNA elongation is stopped by the insertion of C_D015215 into the chain in place of C_D013936 thus preventing the C_D010710 hydroxyl linkages and therefore suppresses hemopoietic progenitor cell proliferation in an early stage of differentiation. CBA/Ca male mice started on C_D015215 0.75 mg/ml H2O at 84 days of age and kept on it for 687 days when dosage reduced to 0.5 mg/ml H2O for a group, another group removed from C_D015215 to see recovery, and third group remained on 0.75 mg. At 687 days mice that had been on 0.75 mg had average platelet counts of 2.5 x 10(6). Histological examination on 9 of 10 mice with such D_D013921 showed changes compatible with D_D009190 (D_D009190). A variety of histological patterns was observed. There were two cases of hypocellular D_D009190, two cases of hypersegmented D_D009190 granulocytosis, two cases of hypercellular marrow with abnormal megakaryocytes with bizarre nuclei, one case of megakaryocytic myelosis associated with a D_D001855, D_D009190 and a D_D001855 and two cases of D_D009190 with D_-1, D_D006486 and a D_D001855. Above mentioned C_D015215 incorporation may have induced an ineffective hemopoiesis in the primitive hemopoietic progenitor cells, which is known to be seen commonly in the D_D009190.

title:Influence of diet free of C_D009243-precursors on C_D000082 D_D056486 in mice.
abstract:Recently, we demonstrated the hepatoprotective effects of C_D009536, a selective inhibitor of C_D011064 polymerase (PARP; EC 2.4.2.30) on mice suffering from C_D000082 (C_D000082)-D_D056486, suggesting that the C_D000082-induced D_D056486 involves a step which depends on adenoribosylation. The present study investigates the effects of a diet free of precursors of C_D009243, the substrate on which PARP acts, in female NMRI mice with C_D000082 D_D056486 and evaluates the influence of simultaneous C_D000431 consumption in these animals. D_D056486 were quantified as serum activities of C_D018698-C_D062907 transaminase (GOT) and C_D018698-C_D019289 transaminase (GPT). While C_D000082 caused a 117-fold elevation of serum transaminase activities in mice kept on a standard laboratory diet, which was significantly exacerbated by C_D000431 and inhibited by C_D009536 (C_D009536), adverse effects were noted in animals fed a diet free of precursors of C_D009243. In these animals, only minor increases of serum transaminase activities were measured in the presence of C_D000082, and unlike the exacerbation caused by C_D000431 in mice on a standard diet, the D_D056486 was inhibited by 50% by C_D000431. A further 64% reduction of D_D056486 was observed, when C_D009536 was given to C_D000431/C_D000082-mice. Our results provide evidence that the C_D000082-induced D_D056486 and its exacerbation by C_D000431 can either be reduced by end-product inhibition of PARP by C_D009536 or by dietary depletion of the enzyme's substrate C_D009243. We see the main application of C_D009536 as for the combinational use in pharmaceutical preparations of C_D000082 in order to avoid D_D056486 in patients treated with this widely used analgesic.

title:Antiarrhythmic plasma concentrations of C_C032151 on canine D_D001145.
abstract:Using two-stage coronary ligation-, C_D004071-, and C_D004837-induced canine D_D001145, antiarrhythmic effects of C_C032151 were examined and the minimum effective plasma concentration for each D_D001145 model was determined. C_C032151 suppressed all the D_D001145s, and the minimum effective plasma concentrations for D_D001145s induced by 24-h coronary ligation, 48-h coronary ligation, C_D004071, and C_D004837 were 1.9 +/- 0.9 (by 8 mg/kg i.v.), 1.6 +/- 0.5 (by 8 mg/kg i.v.), 0.6 +/- 0.2 (by 2 mg/kg i.v.), and 3.5 +/- 1.3 (by 5 mg/kg i.v.) micrograms/ml, respectively (mean +/- SDM, n = 6-7). The concentration for C_D004837-induced D_D001145 was significantly higher than those for the other types of D_D001145s. This pharmacological profile is similar to those of C_D008801 and C_D016677, and all three drugs have central nervous system (CNS) stimulant action. Because C_C032151 had only weak D_D007022 and sinus node D_D003866 effects and was found to be orally active when given to coronary ligation D_D001145 dogs, its clinical usefulness is expected.

abstract:Four patients with D_D001172 developed heavy D_D011507 after five to 12 months of treatment with D-C_D010396. Light microscopy of renal biopsy samples showed minimal glomerular capillary wall thickening and mesangial matrix increase, or no departure from normal. Electron microscopy, however, revealed subepithelial electron-dense deposits, fusion of epithelial cell foot processes, and evidence of mesangial cell hyperactivity. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated granular capillary wall deposits of IgG and C3. The findings were similar to those in early D_D015433, differences being observed however in the results of staining for the early-acting complement components C1q and C4. It is tentatively concluded that complement was activated by the classical pathway.

title:Rapid reversal of anticoagulation reduces D_D006470 volume in a mouse model of C_D014859-associated intracerebral D_D006470.
abstract:C_D014859-associated intracerebral D_D006470 (W-D_D002543) is a severe type of D_D020521. There is no consensus on the optimal treatment for W-D_D002543. Using a mouse model, we tested whether the rapid reversal of anticoagulation using human C_C025667 (C_C025667) can reduce hemorrhagic blood volume. Male CD-1 mice were treated with C_D014859 (2 mg/kg over 24 h), resulting in a mean (+/-s.d.) International Normalized Ratio of 3.5+/-0.9. First, we showed that an intravenous administration of human C_C025667 rapidly reversed anticoagulation in mice. Second, a stereotactic injection of collagenase was administered to induce D_D006470 in the right striatum. Forty-five minutes later, the animals were randomly treated with C_C025667 (100 U/kg) or saline i.v. (n=12 per group). Twenty-four hours after D_D006470 induction, hemorrhagic blood volume was quantified using a photometric hemoglobin assay. The mean hemorrhagic blood volume was reduced in C_C025667-treated animals (6.5+/-3.1 microL) compared with saline controls (15.3+/-11.2 microL, P=0.015). In the saline group, 45% of the mice developed large D_D006406 (i.e., >15 microL). In contrast, such extensive lesions were never found in the C_C025667 group. We provide experimental data suggesting C_C025667 to be an effective acute treatment for W-D_D002543 in terms of reducing hemorrhagic blood volume. Future studies are needed to assess the therapeutic potential emerging from our finding for human W-D_D002543.

title:Impact of C_D000431 exposure after pregnancy recognition on ultrasonographic fetal growth measures.
abstract:BACKGROUND: More than 3 decades after Jones and Smith (1973) reported on the devastation caused by C_D000431 exposure on fetal development, the rates of heavy drinking during pregnancy remain relatively unchanged. Early identification of fetal C_D000431 exposure and maternal abstinence led to better infant outcomes. This study examined the utility of biometry for detecting C_D000431-related fetal D_D006130. METHODS: We obtained fetal ultrasound measures from routine ultrasound examinations for 167 pregnant hazardous drinkers who were enrolled in a brief C_D000431 intervention study. The fetal measures for women who quit after learning of their pregnancies were compared with measures for women who continued some drinking throughout the course of their pregnancies. Because intensity of C_D000431 consumption is associated with poorer fetal outcomes, separate analyses were conducted for the heavy (average of >or=5 drinks per drinking day) C_D000431 consumers. Fetal measures from the heavy-exposed fetuses were also compared with measures from a nondrinking group that was representative of normal, uncomplicated pregnancies from our clinics. Analyses of covariance were used to determine whether there were differences between groups after controlling for influences of gestational age and D_D019966. RESULTS: Nearly half of the pregnant drinkers abstained after learning of their pregnancies. When women reportedly quit drinking early in their pregnancies, fetal growth measures were not significantly different from a non-C_D000431-exposed group, regardless of prior drinking patterns. Any C_D000431 consumption postpregnancy recognition among the heavy drinkers resulted in D_D006130 as well as D_D006130 in comparison with women who either quit drinking or who were nondrinkers. C_D000661 abuse was predictive of larger cranial to body growth ratios. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in fetal biometric measurements were observed among the heavy drinkers only when they continued drinking after becoming aware of their pregnancies. Although the reliance on self-reported drinking is a limitation in this study, these findings support the benefits of early abstinence and the potential for ultrasound examinations in the detection of fetal C_D000431 effects.

title:Urinary symptoms and quality of life changes in Thai women with D_D053201 after C_C099041 treatment.
abstract:OBJECTIVES: To study the urinary symptoms and quality of life changes in Thai women with D_D053201 (D_D053201) after C_C099041 treatment. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Thirty women (aged 30-77 years) diagnosed as having D_D053201 at the Gynecology Clinic, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from January to April 2004 were included in the present study. C_C099041 2 mg, twice daily was given. After 8 weeks treatment, changes in micturition diary variables and tolerability were determined. Short form 36 (SF36) questionaires (Thai version) were given before and after 8 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: At 8 weeks, all micturition per day decreased from 16. 7 +/- 5. 3 to 6. 7 +/- 2.4 times per day. The number of D_D053158 episodes decreased from 5.4 +/- 4.2 to 1.1 +/- 1.0 times per night. The most common side effect was D_D014987 in 5 cases (16.7%) with 2 cases reporting a moderate degree and 1 case with severe degree. Only one case (3.3%) withdrew from the present study due to a severe D_D014987. The SF-36 scores changed significantly in the domains of physical functioning, role function emotional, social function and mental heath. CONCLUSION: C_C099041 was well tolerated and its effects improved the quality of life in Thai women with D_D053201.

title:Absence of acute cerebral vasoconstriction after C_D003042-associated D_D013345.
abstract:INTRODUCTION: C_D003042 use has been associated with D_D013901, including arterial vasoconstriction and D_D014657. However, there are few studies of angiographic effects of C_D003042 on human cerebral arteries. Information on these effects could be obtained from angiograms of patients with C_D003042-associated D_D013345 (D_D013345) who underwent angiography shortly after C_D003042 use. METHODS: We screened patients with D_D013345 retrospectively and identified those with positive urine toxicology for C_D003042 or its metabolites. Quantitative arterial diameter measurements from angiograms of these patients were compared to measurements from control patients with D_D013345 who were matched for factors known to influence arterial diameter. Qualitative comparisons of small artery changes also were made. RESULTS: Thirteen patients with positive C_D003042 toxicology were compared to 26 controls. There were no significant differences between groups in the mean diameters of the intradural internal carotid, sphenoidal segment of the middle cerebral, precommunicating segment of the anterior cerebral, or basilar arteries (p greater than 0.05 for all comparisons, unpaired t-tests). There also were no significant differences between groups when expressing diameters as the sum of the precommunicating segment of the anterior cerebral + sphenoidal segment of the middle cerebral + supraclinoid internal carotid artery + basilar artery divided by the diameter of the petrous internal carotid artery (p greater than 0.05, unpaired t-tests). Qualitative assessments showed two arterial irregularities in the distal vasculature in each group. CONCLUSION: No quantitative evidence for narrowing of large cerebral arteries or qualitative angiographic evidence for distal narrowing or D_D014657 could be found in patients who underwent angiography after D_D017542 D_D013345 associated with C_D003042 use.

title:D_D001281 following chemotherapy for stage IIIE diffuse large B-cell D_C535648 in a patient with D_D009223 (D_D009223).
abstract:The authors describe the unusual association between diffuse B-cell D_C535648 and D_D009223, the most common form of adult D_D009136, and sudden D_D001281 following one cycle of C_D004317-based chemotherapy in the same patient. D_D001281 or other D_D001145 are unusual complications in patients treated with chemotherapy. The D_D066126 intrinsically associated with the aggressive chemotherapy employed could function as a triggering factor for the D_D001145 in the predisposed myocardium of this patient.

title:A phase II study of C_D013792 in advanced metastatic D_D002292.
abstract:OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the D_D064420 and activity of C_D013792 in patients with advanced metastatic D_D002292 and to measure changes of one angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)165, with therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 29 patients were enrolled on a study of C_D013792 using an intra-patient dose escalation schedule. Patients began C_D013792 at 400 mg/d and escalated as tolerated to 1200 mg/d by day 54. Fifty-nine per cent of patients had had previous therapy with IL-2 and 52% were performance status 2 or 3. Systemic plasma VEGF165 levels were measured by dual monoclonal ELISA in 8 patients. RESULTS: 24 patients were evaluable for response with one partial response of 11 months duration of a patient with hepatic and pulmonary D_D009362 (4%), one minor response, and 2 patients stable for over 6 months. D_D006970 and D_D003248 were prominent D_D064420 and most patients could not tolerate the 1200 mg/day dose level. Systemic plasma VEGF165 levels did not change with therapy. CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with a low level of activity of C_D013792 in D_D002292. Administration of doses over 800 mg/day was difficult to achieve in this patient population, however lower doses were practical. The dose-response relationship, if any, of C_D013792 for D_D002292 is unclear.

title:The striatum as a target for anti-rigor effects of an antagonist of mGluR1, but not an agonist of group II metabotropic C_D018698 receptors.
abstract:The aim of the present study was to find out whether the metabotropic receptor 1 (mGluR1) and group II mGluRs, localized in the striatum, are involved in antiD_D010300-like effects in rats. C_D006220 (1 mg/kg ip) induced D_D010300-like D_D009127, measured as an increased resistance of a rat's hind foot to passive flexion and extension at the ankle joint. C_C095756 (C_C095756; 0.5-15 microg/0.5 microl), a potent and selective mGluR1 antagonist, or C_C097299 (C_C097299; 7.5-15 microg/0.5 microl), a selective group II agonist, was injected bilaterally into the striatum of C_D006220-treated animals. C_C095756 in doses of 7.5-15 microg/0.5 microl diminished the C_D006220-induced D_D009127. In contrast, C_C097299 injections were ineffective. The present results may suggest that the blockade of striatal mGluR1, but not the stimulation of group II mGluRs, may ameliorate D_D010300 D_D009127.

title:Acute cholestatic D_D056486 after exposure to C_D007530.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: To report a case of acute cholestatic D_D056486 following exposure to the inhalational anesthetic C_D007530. CASE SUMMARY: A 70-year-old healthy woman from Iraq developed acute cholestatic D_D056486 3 weeks following repair of the right rotator cuff under general anesthesia. There was no evidence for viral, autoimmune, or metabolic causes of D_D056486. No other medications were involved except for C_D004177 for D_D000699. The C_D000409 aminotransferase was elevated to a peak concentration of 1533 U/L and the serum C_D001663 reached a peak of 17.0 mg/dL. There was slow improvement over 4 months. Accidental reexposure by the patient to C_D004177 was uneventful. DISCUSSION: The clinical and histologic picture of this case resembles halothane D_D056486, which has a significant mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: C_D007530, a common anesthetic agent, can cause severe cholestatic D_D056486.

title:Calcitonin gene-related peptide levels during C_D009569-induced D_D006261 in patients with chronic tension-type D_D006261.
abstract:It has been proposed that C_D009569 (C_D009569) induced D_D006261 in primary D_D006261s may be associated with release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). In the present study we aimed to investigate plasma levels of CGRP during D_D006261 induced by the C_D009569 donor C_D005996 (C_D005996) in 16 patients with chronic tension-type D_D006261 and 16 healthy controls. The subjects were randomly allocated to receive 0.5 microg/kg/min C_D005996 or placebo over 20 min on two D_D006261-free days. Blood samples were collected at baseline, 10, 20 and 60 min after start of infusion. Both patients and controls developed significantly stronger immediate D_D006261 on the C_D005996 day than on the placebo day and the D_D006261 was significantly more pronounced in patients than in controls. There was no difference between the area under the CGRP curve (AUCCGRP) on C_D005996 vs. placebo day in either patients (P=0.65) or controls (P=0.48). The AUCCGRP recorded on the C_D005996 day did not differ between patients and controls (P=0.36). Both in patients and controls, CGRP levels changed significantly over time, on both the C_D005996 and placebo days (P < 0.05). The present study indicates that C_D009569-induced immediate D_D006261 is not associated with release of CGRP.

title:D_D017202 due to D_D003329 during C_D004280 stress echocardiography.
abstract:C_D004280 stress echocardiography (DSE) is a useful and safe provocation test for D_D017202. Until now, the test has been focused only on the organic lesion in the coronary artery, and positive DSE has indicated the presence of significant fixed D_D023921. The aim of the present study is to examine whether D_D017202 due to D_D003329 is induced by C_D004280. We performed DSE on 51 patients with D_D000788 but without significant fixed D_D023921. All patients had D_D000787 attacks at rest with ST elevation on the electrocardiogram (D_D000788). Coronary spasm was induced by intracoronary injection of C_D000109, and no fixed D_D023921 was documented on angiograms in all patients. DSE was performed with intravenous C_D004280 infusion with an incremental doses of 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 microg/kg/min every 5 minutes. Of the 51 patients, 7 patients showed asynergy with ST elevation. All 7 patients (13.7%) had D_D002637 during asynergy, and both D_D002637 and electrocardiographic changes were preceded by asynergy. These findings indicate that C_D004280 can provoke D_D003329 in some patients with D_D000788. When DSE is performed to evaluate D_D003324, not only fixed D_D023921, but also D_D003329 should be considered as a genesis of asynergy.

title:C_D009569 synthase expression in the course of C_D007854-induced D_D006973.
abstract:We recently showed elevated reactive C_D010100 species (ROS), reduced urinary excretion of C_D009569 metabolites (C_D009569x), and increased C_D009569 sequestration as C_C002744 in various tissues in rats with C_D007854-induced D_D006973. This study was designed to discern whether the reduction in urinary C_D009569x in C_D007854-induced D_D006973 is, in part, due to depressed C_D009569 synthase (C_D009569S) expression. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to a C_D007854-treated group (given C_D007854 acetate, 100 ppm, in drinking water and regular rat chow), a group given C_D007854 and C_D014810-fortified chow, or a normal control group given either regular food and water or C_D014810-fortified food for 12 weeks. Tail blood pressure, urinary C_D009569x excretion, plasma C_D008315 (C_D008315), and endothelial and inducible C_D009569S (eC_D009569S and iC_D009569S) isotypes in the aorta and kidney were measured. The C_D007854-treated group exhibited a rise in blood pressure and plasma C_D008315 concentration, a fall in urinary C_D009569x excretion, and a paradoxical rise in vascular and renal tissue eC_D009569S and iC_D009569S expression. C_D014810 supplementation ameliorated D_D006973, lowered plasma C_D008315 concentration, and raised urinary C_D009569x excretion while significantly lowering vascular, but not renal, tissue eC_D009569S and iC_D009569S expression. C_D014810 supplementation had no effect on either blood pressure, plasma C_D008315, or C_D009569S expression in the control group. The study also revealed significant inhibition of C_D009569S enzymatic activity by C_D007854 in cell-free preparations. In conclusion, C_D007854-induced D_D006973 in this model was associated with a compensatory upregulation of renal and vascular eC_D009569S and iC_D009569S expression. This is, in part, due to ROS-mediated C_D009569 inactivation, C_D007854-associated inhibition of C_D009569S activity, and perhaps stimulatory actions of increased shear stress associated with D_D006973.

title:Risk for D_D006349 among users of C_D005277 and dexC_D005277 who underwent echocardiography before use of medication.
abstract:BACKGROUND: Because uncontrolled echocardiographic surveys suggested that up to 30% to 38% of users of C_D005277 and dexC_D005277 had D_D006349, these drugs were withdrawn from the market. OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk for new or worsening D_D006349 among users of C_D005277 or dexC_D005277 who underwent echocardiography before they began to take these medications. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Academic primary care practices. PATIENTS: 46 patients who used C_D005277 or dexC_D005277 for 14 days or more and had echocardiograms obtained before therapy. MEASUREMENTS: Follow-up echocardiography. The primary outcome was new or worsening D_D006349, defined as progression of either aortic or D_D008944 by at least one degree of severity and disease that met U.S. Food and Drug Administration criteria (at least mild D_D001022 or moderate D_D008944). RESULTS: Two patients (4.3% [95% CI, 0.6% to 14.8%]) receiving C_D005277-C_D010645 developed D_D006349. One had baseline D_C562388 and mild D_D001022 that progressed to moderate regurgitation. The second patient developed new moderate D_D001022. CONCLUSION: Users of diet medications are at risk for D_D006349. However, the incidence may be lower than that reported previously.

title:C_D016190 toxic effects on the peripheral nervous system of the rat.
abstract:BACKGROUND: The most striking of C_D016190's advantages (C_D016190) over C_D002945 (C_D002945) is its markedly reduced rate of D_D020258 effects. However, the use of C_D016190 higher-intensity schedules and the association with other D_D020258 drugs in polychemotherapy may cause some concern about its safety with respect to D_D010523. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two different schedules of C_D016190 administration (10 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg i.p. twice a week for nine times) were evaluated in Wistar rats. D_D020258 was assessed for behavioral (tail-flick test), neurophysiological (nerve conduction velocity in the tail nerve), morphological, morphometrical and analytical effects. RESULTS: C_D016190 administration induced dose-dependent peripheral D_D020258ity. D_D010146 perception and nerve conduction velocity in the tail were significantly impaired, particularly after the high-dose treatment. The dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons and, to a lesser extent, satellite cells showed the same changes as those induced by C_D002945, mainly affecting the nucleus and nucleolus of ganglionic sensory neurons. Moreover, significant amounts of C_D010984 were detected in the dorsal root ganglia and kidney after C_D016190 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: C_D016190 is D_D020258 in our model, and the type of pathological changes it induces are so closely similar to those caused by C_D002945 that it is probable that D_D020258ity is induced in the two drugs by the same mechanism. This model can be used alone or in combination with other drugs to explore the effect of C_D016190 on the peripheral nervous system.

title:Iatrogenic risks of D_D016889 after treatment for D_D001943 in a large French case-control study. F  d  ration Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer (FNCLCC).
abstract:Since C_D013629 is widely used in D_D001943 treatment and has been proposed for the prevention of D_D001943, its endometrial iatrogenic effects must be carefully examined. We have investigated the association between D_D016889 and C_D013629 use or other treatments in women treated for D_D001943 in a case-control study. Cases of D_D016889 diagnosed after D_D001943 (n = 135) and 467 controls matched for age, year of diagnosis of D_D001943 and hospital and survival time with an intact uterus were included. Women who had received C_D013629 were significantly more likely to have D_D016889 diagnosed than those who had not (crude relative risk = 4.9, p = 0.0001). Univariate and adjusted analyses showed that the risk increased with the length of treatment (p = 0.0001) or the cumulative dose of C_D013629 received (p = 0.0001), irrespective of the daily dose. Women who had undergone pelvic radiotherapy also had a higher risk (crude relative risk = 7.8, p = 0.0001). After adjusting for confounding factors, the risk was higher for C_D013629 users (p = 0.0012), treatment for more than 3 years (all p < 0.03) and pelvic radiotherapy (p = 0.012). Women who had D_D016889 and had received C_D013629 had more D_D020178 and poorer prognosis than those with D_D016889 who had not received this treatment. Our results suggest a causal role of C_D013629 in D_D016889, particularly when used as currently proposed for D_D001943 prevention. Pelvic radiotherapy may be an additional iatrogenic factor for women with D_D001943. D_D016889 diagnosed in women treated with C_D013629 have poorer prognosis. Women who receive C_D013629 for D_D001943 should be offered gynaecological surveillance during and after treatment. A long-term evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio of C_D013629 as a preventive treatment for D_D001943 is clearly warranted.

title:D_C537296 associated with antecedent C_D013629 use.
abstract:BACKGROUND: Increased attention has been focused recently on the C_D004967ic effects of C_D013629. Review of the literature reveals an association between C_D013629 use and gynecologic D_D009369. CASE: A 52-year-old postmenopausal woman was treated with C_D013629 for stage II C_D004967 receptor-positive D_D001943. Her C_D001224 transaminase and C_D000409 transaminase levels increase markedly after 6 months of C_D013629 use. After an additional 17 months of elevated serum transaminases, the patient was found to have a stage Ic D_C537296. CONCLUSION: Patients with C_D013629-induced D_D017093 may be at increased risk for granulosa cell D_D009369 because of alterations in C_D013629 metabolism.

title:A murine model of D_D062788: the effects of D_D006966 induced by C_D005473, a selective C_D012701 reuptake inhibitor, on D_D062788 induction in Wistar albino rats.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether C_D005473 given to castrated and noncastrated rats caused D_D006966 and its effects with respect to D_D062788. DESIGN: C_D005473, a C_D012701 reuptake inhibitor, was given to Wistar Albino rats for 98 days to produce D_D006966. The drug was given to two groups consisting of castrated and noncastrated rats and compared to two groups of castrated and noncastrated controls. Prolactin levels were measured and the uteri of the rats were removed for histopathological analysis at the end of 98 days. SETTING: Marmara University School of Medicine, Department of Histology and Embryology, Zeynep Kamil Women and Children's Hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum prolactin levels, uterine histopathology. RESULTS: The prolactin levels of castrated and noncastrated groups treated with C_D005473 were statistically significantly higher when compared to their respective control groups. Histological studies revealed 11 cases of D_D062788, all within the noncastrated group receiving C_D005473. CONCLUSION: It was suggested that high serum prolactin levels cause degeneration of myometrial cells in the presence of ovarian C_D013256 that results in a myometrial invasion by endometrial stroma. This invasion eventually progresses to D_D062788.

title:Effects of deliberate D_D007022 induced by C_D007741 with C_D007530 on neuropsychological function.
abstract:The effect of deliberate D_D007022 on brain function measured by neuropsychological tests was studied in 41 adult patients. Twenty-four patients were anaesthetized for middle-ear surgery with deliberate D_D007022 induced by C_D007741 with C_D007530 (D_D007022 group). Seventeen patients without D_D007022 served as a control group. The mean arterial pressure was 77 +/- 2 mmHg (10.3 +/- 0.3 kPa) before D_D007022 and 50 +/- 0 mmHg (6.7 +/- 0.0 kPa) during D_D007022 in the D_D007022 group, and 86 +/- 2 mmHg (11.5 +/- 0.3 kPa) during anaesthesia in the control group. The following psychological tests were performed: four subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (similarities, digit span, vocabulary and digit symbol), Trail-Making tests A and B, Zung tests (self-rating D_D001008 scale and self-rating D_D003866 scale) and two-part memory test battery with immediate and delayed recall. The tests were performed preoperatively and 2 days postoperatively. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in any of the tests in the changes from preoperative value to postoperative value. The results indicate that D_D007022 induced by C_D007741 with C_D007530 has no significant harmful effects on mental functions compared to normotensive anaesthesia.

title:Auditory disturbance associated with interscalene brachial plexus block.
abstract:We performed an audiometric study in 20 patients who underwent surgery of the shoulder region under an interscalene brachial plexus block (IBPB). C_D002045 0.75% with C_D004837 was given followed by a 24-hr continuous infusion of 0.25% C_D002045. Three audiometric threshold measurements (0.25-18 kHz) were made: the first before IBPB, the second 2-6 h after surgery and the third on the first day after operation. In four patients D_D034381 on the side of the block was demonstrated after operation, in three measurements on the day of surgery and in one on the following day. The frequencies at which the impairment occurred varied between patients; in one only low frequencies (0.25-0.5 kHz) were involved. The maximum change in threshold was 35 dB at 6 kHz measured at the end of the continuous infusion of C_D002045. This patient had hearing threshold changes (15-20 dB) at 6-10 kHz on the opposite side also. IBPB may cause transient D_D006311 in the ipsilateral ear, possibly via an effect on sympathetic innervation.

abstract:In patients premedicated with C_D012601 + C_D009020 (+5 mg C_D009567 the evening before surgery), the sleep-inducing effect of C_D008874 0.15 mg/kg i.v. was clearly slower in onset than that of C_D013874 4.67 mg/kg i.v. Somewhat fewer cardiovascular and local sequelae were found in the C_D008874 group, but, although D_D001049 occurred less often in the C_D008874 group it lasted longer. On the whole, the differences between C_D008874 and C_D013874 had no apparent clinical consequences. C_D008874 is a new alternative agent for induction in combination anaesthesia.

title:D_D066126 and possible leukemogenic effects of C_D004317 in nonhuman primates.
abstract:10 monkeys (macaques) received C_D004317 by monthly intravenous injections at 12 mg/m2 (1 mg/kg). 8 of the 10 monkeys developed D_D006333 at an average cumulative C_D004317 dose (310 mg/m2) well below that considered the safe upper limit (550 mg/m2) in man. Histologically, the D_D001768 resembled those found in human C_D018943-induced D_D009202. 1 of the 10 monkeys developed D_D015470 after receiving 324 mg/m2 of C_D004317; the 10th monkey is alive and well 26 months after the last dose of drug. Our results suggest that C_D004317 is a more potent cardiotoxin in monkeys than in man, and that D_D007938 may be a consequence of prolonged treatment with this drug.

title:C_D004317 D_D009202 in children with left-sided D_D009396.
abstract:Two children with D_D009396 of the left kidney experienced severe C_D018943 D_D009202 after irradiation to the D_D009369 bed and conventional dosage of C_D004317. The D_D009202 is attributed 1) to the fact that radiation fields for left D_D009396 include the lower portion of the heart and 2) to the interaction of C_D004317 and irradiation on cardiac muscle. It is recommended that C_D004317 dosage be sharply restricted in children with D_D009396 of the left kidney who receive postoperative irradiation.

title:Promotional effects of C_D013739 and dietary fat on prostate D_D063646 in genetically susceptible rats.
abstract:Germfree (GF) Lobund strain Wistar (LW) rats, fed vegetable diet L-485, have developed D_D011471 spontaneously (10% incidence) at average age 34 months. Conventional LW rats, implanted with C_D013739 at age 4 months, developed a higher incidence of D_D011471 after an average interval of 14 months: 24% had developed gross D_D009369, and 40% when it included microscopic D_D009369. Preliminary results indicate that C_D013739-treated LW rats that were fed the same diet, which was supplemented with corn oil up to 20% fat, developed D_D011471 after intervals of 6-12 months. Aged GF Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats have not developed D_D011471 spontaneously. Conventional SD rats fed diet L-485 and treated with C_D013739 developed only D_D011472. Experimental designs should consider genetic susceptibility as a basic prerequisite for studies on experimental D_D011471.

title:C_D016685 associated D_D006463.
abstract:C_D016685 associated D_D006463 (D_D006463) is a potentially fatal but uncommon condition that is not yet widely recognised. It consists of microangiopathic D_D000743, D_D013921 and progressive D_D051437 associated with C_D016685 treatment and affects about 10% of patients treated with this agent. The D_D051437 usually develops about 8-10 mth after start of C_D016685 treatment and the mortality is approximately 60% from D_D051437 or D_D011654. D_D051437 are similar to those seen in idiopathic D_D006463 and include arteriolar fibrin D_D013927, expanded subendothelial zones in glomerular capillary walls, D_D007511 wrinkling of glomerular basement membranes and mesangiolysis. The mechanism of action is postulated as C_D016685-induced endothelial cell damage. We describe the clinical course and pathological findings in a 65 yr-old man with D_D013274 who developed D_D051437 and D_D013921 while on treatment with C_D016685 and died in D_D011654.

title:Continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring during C_D005472 therapy: a prospective study.
abstract:Although there have been anecdotal reports of D_D066126 associated with C_D005472 (C_D005472) therapy, this phenomenon has not been studied in a systematic fashion. We prospectively performed continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring on 25 patients undergoing C_D005472 infusion for treatment of solid D_D009369 in order to assess the incidence of D_D007511 ST changes. Patients were monitored for 23 +/- 4 hours before C_D005472 infusion, and 98 +/- 9 hours during C_D005472 infusion. D_D000787 episodes were rare: only one patient had D_D000787 (during C_D005472 infusion). However, asymptomatic ST changes (greater than or equal to 1 mm ST deviation) were common: six of 25 patients (24%) had ST changes before C_D005472 infusion v 17 (68%) during C_D005472 infusion (P less than .002). The incidence of D_D007511 episodes per patient per hour was 0.05 +/- 0.02 prior to C_D005472 infusion v 0.13 +/- 0.03 during C_D005472 infusion (P less than .001); the duration of ECG changes was 0.6 +/- 0.3 minutes per patient per hour before C_D005472 v 1.9 +/- 0.5 minutes per patient per hour during C_D005472 (P less than .01). ECG changes were more common among patients with known D_D003324. There were two cases of D_D003645, both of which occurred at the end of the chemotherapy course. We conclude that C_D005472 infusion is associated with a significant increase in silent ST segment deviation suggestive of D_D007511, particularly among patients with D_D003324. The mechanism and clinical significance of these ECG changes remain to be determined.

title:Lethal D_D001002 complicating high dose C_D007069 chemotherapy in a D_D001943 patient with an D_D007674.
abstract:A sixty-year-old woman with advanced D_D001943, previously treated with C_D002945, developed an irreversible lethal D_D051437 with D_D001002, the day after 5 g/m2 bolus C_D007069. PostD_D051437 was excluded by echography. A prerenal component could have contributed to D_D051437 because of a transient D_D007022, due to an increasing ascitis, occurring just before D_D001002. However, correction of the hemodynamic parameters did not improve renal function. C_D007069 is a known D_D007674 drug with demonstrated D_D007674. We strongly suspect that this lethal D_D001002 was mainly due to C_D007069, occurring in a patient having received previous C_D002945 chemotherapy and with poor kidney perfusion due to transient D_D007022. We recommend careful use of C_D007069 in patients pretreated with D_D007674 chemotherapy and inadequate renal perfusion.

C_D013999 also reduced the rise in plasma C_D000450 and urine C_D011188 excretion following C_D001539 and increased the urine C_D012964/C_D011188 ratio. There was no evidence of a shift of C_D011188 from the intracellular to the extracellular space.

title:A cross-sectional evaluation of the effect of C_D018967 and selective C_D012701 reuptake inhibitors on bone mineral density in boys.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of C_D018967-induced D_D006966 on trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) in children and adolescents. METHOD: Medically healthy 7- to 17-year-old males chronically treated, in a naturalistic setting, with C_D018967 were recruited for this cross-sectional study through child psychiatry outpatient clinics between November 2005 and June 2007. Anthropometric measurements and laboratory testing were conducted. The clinical diagnoses were based on chart review, and developmental and treatment history was obtained from the medical record. Volumetric BMD of the ultradistal radius was measured using peripheral quantitative computed tomography, and areal BMD of the lumbar spine was estimated using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: D_D006966 was present in 49% of 83 boys (n = 41) treated with C_D018967 for a mean of 2.9 years. Serum C_D013739 concentration increased with pubertal status but was not affected by D_D006966. As expected, bone mineral content and BMD increased with sexual maturity. After adjusting for the stage of sexual development and height and BMI z scores, serum prolactin was negatively associated with trabecular volumetric BMD at the ultradistal radius (P < .03). Controlling for relevant covariates, we also found treatment with selective C_D012701 reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to be associated with lower trabecular BMD at the radius (P = .03) and BMD z score at the lumbar spine (P < .05). These findings became more marked when the analysis was restricted to non-Hispanic white patients. Of 13 documented D_D050723, 3 occurred after C_D018967 and SSRIs were started, and none occurred in patients with D_D006966. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to link C_D018967-induced D_D006966 and SSRI treatment to lower BMD in children and adolescents. Future research should evaluate the longitudinal course of this adverse event to determine its temporal stability and whether a higher fracture rate ensues.

title:D_D012640 associated with C_D064704: case presentation and literature review.
abstract:PURPOSE: We present a case of a patient who developed D_D012640 shortly after initiating treatment with C_D064704 and to discuss the potential drug-drug interactions related to the inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 in this case, as well as in other cases, of C_D064704-induced D_D012640. METHODS: Several biomedical databases were searched including MEDLINE, Cochrane and Ovid. The main search terms utilized were case report and C_D064704. The search was limited to studies published in English. RESULTS: Six cases of C_D064704-induced D_D012640 have been reported in the literature. Drug-drug interactions related to the inhibition of CYP1A2 by C_D064704 are likely involved in the clinical outcome of these cases. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians are exhorted to pay close attention when initiating C_D064704 therapy in patients taking medications with epileptogenic properties that are CYP1A2 substrates.

title:Mice lacking mC_D011453ES-1 are resistant to C_D008094-induced D_D011141.
abstract:Cyclooxygenase-2 activity is required for the development of C_D008094-induced D_D011141. However, the involvement of a specific, terminal C_D011453 (C_D011453) isomerase has not been evaluated. The present study was undertaken to assess C_D008094-induced D_D011141 in mice deficient in microsomal C_D011453 E synthase-1 (mC_D011453ES-1). A 2-wk administration of C_D018021 (4 mmol.kg(-1).day(-1) ip) in mC_D011453ES-1 +/+ mice led to a marked D_D011141 with hyposmotic urine. This was associated with elevated renal mC_D011453ES-1 protein expression and increased urine C_D011453E(2) excretion. In contrast, mC_D011453ES-1 -/- mice were largely resistant to C_D008094-induced D_D011141 and a urine concentrating defect, accompanied by nearly complete blockade of high urine C_D011453E(2) and cAMP output. Immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative (q) RT-PCR consistently detected a significant decrease in aquaporin-2 (AQP2) protein expression in both the renal cortex and medulla of C_D008094-treated +/+ mice. This decrease was significantly attenuated in the -/- mice. qRT-PCR detected similar patterns of changes in AQP2 mRNA in the medulla but not in the cortex. Similarly, the total protein abundance of the C_D012964-C_D011188-2C_D002713 cotransporter (NC_D011188CC2) in the medulla but not in the cortex of the +/+ mice was significantly reduced by C_D008094 treatment. In contrast, the dowregulation of renal medullary NC_D011188CC2 expression was significantly attenuated in the -/- mice. We conclude that mC_D011453ES-1-derived C_D011453E(2) mediates C_D008094-induced D_D011141 likely via inhibition of AQP2 and NC_D011188CC2 expression.

title:Identification of a simple and sensitive microplate method for the detection of oversulfated C_D002809 in C_D006493 products.
abstract:C_D006493 is a commonly implemented anticoagulant used to treat critically ill patients. Recently, a number of commercial lots of C_D006493 products were found to be contaminated with an oversulfated C_D002809 (OSCS) derivative that could elicit a D_D007022 response in pigs following a single high-dose infusion. Using both contaminated C_D006493 products and the synthetically produced derivative, we showed that the OSCS produces dose-dependent D_D007022 in pigs. The no observed effect level (NOEL) for this contaminant appears to be approximately 1mg/kg, corresponding to a contamination level of approximately 3%. We also demonstrated that OSCS can be identified in C_D006493 products using a simple, inexpensive, commercially available C_D006493 enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit that has a limit of detection of approximately 0.1%, well below the NOEL. This kit may provide a useful method to test C_D006493 products for contamination with oversulfated GAG derivatives.

title:C_D004317 D_D009202-induced D_D007249 and apoptosis are attenuated by gene deletion of the kinin B1 receptor.
abstract:Clinical use of the C_D018943 C_D004317 (C_D004317) is limited by its D_D066126 effects, which are attributed to the induction of apoptosis. To elucidate the possible role of the kinin B1 receptor (B1R) during the development of C_D004317 D_D009202, we studied B1R knockout mice (B1R(-/-)) by investigating cardiac D_D007249 and apoptosis after induction of C_D004317-induced D_D009202. C_D004317 control mice showed D_D006331 measured by pressure-volume loops in vivo. This was associated with a reduced activation state of AKT, as well as an increased bax/bcl2 ratio in Western blots, indicating D_D006331. Furthermore, mRNA levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 were increased in the cardiac tissue. In C_D004317 B1R(-/-) mice, D_D006331 was improved compared to C_D004317 control mice, which was associated with normalization of the bax/bcl-2 ratio and interleukin 6, as well as AKT activation state. These findings suggest that B1R is detrimental in C_D004317 D_D009202 in that it mediates the inflammatory response and apoptosis. These insights might have useful implications for future studies utilizing B1R antagonists for treatment of human C_D004317 D_D009202.

title:D_D056486 associated with C_D012460 in inflammatory D_D001168: A case series from a local surveillance of serious adverse events.
abstract:BACKGROUND: Spontaneous reporting systems for adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are handicapped by under-reporting and limited detail on individual cases. We report an investigation from a local surveillance for serious adverse drug reactions associated with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs that was triggered by the occurrence of D_D017093 in two of our patients. METHODS: Serious ADR reports have been solicited from local clinicians by regular postcards over the past seven years. Patients', who had D_D056486 on C_D012460 and met a definition of a serious ADR, were identified. Two clinicians reviewed structured case reports and assessed causality by consensus and by using a causality assessment instrument. The likely frequency of D_D056486 with C_D012460 was estimated by making a series of conservative assumptions. RESULTS: Ten cases were identified: eight occurred during surveillance. Eight patients were hospitalised, two in D_D017093 - one died after a liver transplant. All but one event occurred within 6 weeks of treatment. Seven patients had a D_D005076, three D_D004802 and one D_D009395. Five patients were of Black British of African or Caribbean descent. Liver enzymes showed a hepatocellular pattern in four cases and a mixed pattern in six. Drug-related D_D056486 was judged probable or highly probable in 8 patients. The likely frequency of serious D_D056486 with C_D012460 was estimated at 0.4% of treated patients. CONCLUSION: Serious D_D056486 associated with C_D012460 appears to be under-appreciated and intensive monitoring and vigilance in the first 6 weeks of treatment is especially important.

title:An evaluation of C_D000583 D_D007674 in the hematology/oncology population.
abstract:C_D000583 is an C_D000617 commonly used to provide empirical double gram-negative treatment for D_D009503 and other suspected D_D007239. Strategies of extended-interval and conventional dosing have been utilized extensively in the general medical population; however, data are lacking to support a dosing strategy in the hematology/oncology population. To evaluate C_D000583-associated D_D007674 in an adult hematology/oncology population, a prospective, randomized, open-label trial was conducted at a university-affiliated medical center. Forty patients with a diagnosis consistent with a hematologic/oncologic disorder that required treatment with an C_D000617 were randomized to either conventional or extended-interval C_D000583. The occurrence of D_D007674 by means of an increase in serum C_D003404 and evaluation of efficacy via C_D000583 serum concentrations with respective pathogens were assessed. The occurrence of D_D007674 was similar between the conventional and extended-interval groups, at 10% and 5%, respectively (P = 1.00). Six patients in the conventional group had a positive culture, compared with none in the extended-interval group (P = 0.002). The occurrence of D_D007674 was similar between the two dosing regimens, but the distribution of risk factors was variable between the two groups. Efficacy could not be assessed.

title:Memory function and C_D012701 transporter promoter gene polymorphism in C_D018817 (C_D018817) users.
abstract:Although C_D018817 (C_D018817 or C_D018817) has been shown to damage brain C_D012701 (C_D012701) neurons in animals and possibly humans, little is known about the long-term consequences of C_D018817-induced C_D012701 D_D020258 on functions in which C_D012701 is involved, such as cognitive function. Because C_D012701 transporters play a key element in the regulation of synaptic C_D012701 transmission it may be important to control for the potential covariance effect of a polymorphism in the C_D012701 transporter promoter gene region (C_D012701TLPR) when studying the effects of C_D018817 as well as cognitive functioning. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of moderate and heavy C_D018817 use on cognitive function, as well as the effects of long-term abstention from C_D018817, in subjects genotyped for C_D012701TLPR. A second aim of the study was to determine whether these effects differ for females and males. Fifteen moderate C_D018817 users (<55 lifetime tablets), 22 heavy C_D018817+ users (>55 lifetime tablets), 16 ex-C_D018817+ users (last tablet > 1 year ago) and 13 controls were compared on a battery of neuropsychological tests. DNA from peripheral nuclear blood cells was genotyped for C_D012701TLPR using standard polymerase chain reaction methods.A significant group effect was observed only on memory function tasks (p = 0.04) but not on reaction times (p = 0.61) or attention/executive functioning (p = 0.59). Heavy and ex-C_D018817+ users performed significantly poorer on memory tasks than controls. In contrast, no evidence of D_D008569 was observed in moderate C_D018817 users. No significant effect of C_D012701TLPR or gender was observed. While the use of C_D018817 in quantities that may be considered "moderate" is not associated with D_D008569, heavy use of C_D018817 use may lead to long lasting D_D008569s. No effect of C_D012701TLPR or gender on memory function or C_D018817 use was observed.

C_D013739he study was performed on sexually mature male rats. Serum concentrations of prolactin (C_D011388) and C_D013739 (C_D013739) were measured. C_D013739issue sections were evaluated with light and electron microscopy. Immunohistochemical reactions for Anti-Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) were performed. In rats of the experimental group, the mean concentration of: C_D011388 was more than twice higher, whereas C_D013739 concentration was almost twice lower than that in the control group. Light microscopy visualized the following: D_D006984 and epithelium D_D006965 of the glandular ducts, associated with increased PCNA expression. Electron microscopy revealed changes in columnar epithelial cells, concerning organelles, engaged in protein synthesis and secretion.

title:Does supplemental C_D001205 increase D_D002318 risk in women with D_D003920?
abstract:BACKGROUND: C_D001205 acts as a potent antioxidant; however, it can also be a prooxidant and glycate protein under certain circumstances in vitro. These observations led us to hypothesize that a high intake of C_D001205 in D_D003920 persons might promote D_D050197. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the relation between C_D001205 intake and mortality from D_D002318. DESIGN: We studied the relation between C_D001205 intake and mortality from total D_D002318 (n = 281), D_D003324 (n = 175), and D_D020521 (n = 57) in 1923 postmenopausal women who reported being D_D003920 at baseline. Diet was assessed with a food-frequency questionnaire at baseline, and subjects initially free of D_D003324 were prospectively followed for 15 y. RESULTS: After adjustment for D_D002318 risk factors, type of D_D003920 medication used, duration of D_D003920, and intakes of C_D005492, C_D014810, and C_D019207, the adjusted relative risks of total D_D002318 mortality were 1.0, 0.97, 1.11, 1.47, and 1.84 (P for trend < 0.01) across quintiles of total C_D001205 intake from food and supplements. Adjusted relative risks of D_D003324 were 1.0, 0.81, 0.99, 1.26, and 1.91 (P for trend = 0.01) and of D_D020521 were 1.0, 0.52, 1.23, 2.22, and 2.57 (P for trend < 0.01). When dietary and supplemental C_D001205 were analyzed separately, only supplemental C_D001205 showed a positive association with mortality endpoints. C_D001205 intake was unrelated to mortality from D_D002318 in the nonD_D003920 subjects at baseline. CONCLUSION: A high C_D001205 intake from supplements is associated with an increased risk of D_D002318 mortality in postmenopausal women with D_D003920.

METHODS: From the Danish National Register of Patients (NRP), 1996 to 1998, the records of 1.1 million Danish women, ages 15 to 44 years, were searched for evidence of D_D054556. C_D003277 use was ascertained through mailed questionnaires. Sales statistics of C_D003277 and C_D017373/C_D004997 were provided through Danish Drug Statistics. RESULTS: During the time frame of the study, 330 women were found to have had D_D054556 while on C_D003277. Of these women, 67 were on C_D016912-containing C_D003277. Eleven were on C_D017373/C_D004997. The corresponding absolute risk of D_D054556 was 3.4 (range, 3.1-3.8) per 10 000 women years among the women on C_D003277, 4.2 (range, 3.2-5.2) per 10 000 women years among women on C_D016912-containing C_D003277, and 3.1 (range, 1.3-4.9) per 10 000 women years among the women on C_D017373/C_D004997. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the absolute risk of D_D054556 among Danish women on C_D003277 is similar to that among women taking C_D017373/C_D004997.

title:Effect of C_D001556 on hepatic and brain cytochrome P450s and influence of P450 modulation in C_D001556 induced D_D020258.
abstract:Oral administration of C_D001556 (2.5, 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg, body weight) for 5 days was found to produce a dose-dependent increase in the activity of P450 dependent 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), 7-pentoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase (PROD) and C_D004128 demethylase (C_D004128-d) in rat brain and liver. A significant increase in the hepatic and brain P450 monooxygenases was also observed when the duration of exposure of low dose (2.5 mg/kg) of C_D001556 was increased from 5 days to 15 or 21 days. As observed with different doses, the magnitude of induction in the activity of P450 monooxygenases was several fold higher in liver microsomes when compared with the brain. Western blotting studies have indicated that the increase in the P450 enzymes could be due to the increase in the expression of P450 1A1/1A2, 2B1/2B2 and 2E1 isoenzymes. In vitro studies using organic inhibitors specific for individual P450 isoenzymes and antibody inhibition experiments have further demonstrated that the increase in the activity of PROD, EROD and C_D004128-d are due to the increase in the levels of P450 2B1/2B2, 1A1/1A2 and 2E1 isoenzymes, respectively. Induction studies have further shown that while pretreatment of C_D008748 (C_D008748), an inducer of P4501A1/1A2, did not produce any significant effect in the incidence of C_D001556 induced D_D012640, pretreatment with C_D010634 (PB), an inducer of P450 2B1/2B2 or C_D000431, an inducer of P450 2E1 catalysed reactions, significantly increased the incidence of C_D001556 induced D_D012640. Similarly, when the P450-mediated metabolism of C_D001556 was blocked by C_C018021 incidence of D_D012640 was increased in animals treated with C_D001556 indicating that C_D001556 per se or its metabolites formed by PB or C_D000431 inducible P450 isoenzymes are involved in its neurobehavioral D_D064420.

title:D_D012640 associated with D_D012892 and sustained-release C_D016642.
abstract:This case report describes a generalized D_D012640 associated with sustained-release C_D016642 use and D_D012892. The subject, a 31-year-old female smoker, was participating in a clinical trial evaluating an investigational medication for smoking cessation that used sustained-release C_D016642 as an active control. After 5 weeks of C_D016642 use, the subject experienced a generalized tonic clonic D_D012640 after staying up nearly all night packing and moving to a new residence. The patient had no other risk factors for D_D012640s. We suggest that D_D012892 may add to the risk of C_D016642-associated D_D012640s.

title:D_D007674 effects in high-risk patients undergoing angiography.
abstract:BACKGROUND: The use of iodinated contrast medium can result in D_D007674. Whether iso-osmolar contrast medium is less D_D007674 than low-osmolar contrast medium in high-risk patients is uncertain. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, prospective, multicenter study comparing the D_D007674 effects of an iso-osmolar, dimeric, nonionic contrast medium, C_C044834, with those of a low-osmolar, nonionic, monomeric contrast medium, C_D007472. The study involved 129 patients with D_D003920 with serum C_D003404 concentrations of 1.5 to 3.5 mg per deciliter who underwent coronary or aortofemoral angiography. The primary end point was the peak increase from base line in the C_D003404 concentration during the three days after angiography. Other end points were an increase in the C_D003404 concentration of 0.5 mg per deciliter or more, an increase of 1.0 mg per deciliter or more, and a change in the C_D003404 concentration from day 0 to day 7. RESULTS: The C_D003404 concentration increased significantly less in patients who received C_C044834. From day 0 to day 3, the mean peak increase in C_D003404 was 0.13 mg per deciliter in the C_C044834 group and 0.55 mg per deciliter in the C_D007472 group (P=0.001; the increase with C_C044834 minus the increase with C_D007472, -0.42 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.73 to -0.22]). Two of the 64 patients in the C_C044834 group (3 percent) had an increase in the C_D003404 concentration of 0.5 mg per deciliter or more, as compared with 17 of the 65 patients in the C_D007472 group (26 percent) (P=0.002; odds ratio for such an increase in the C_C044834 group, 0.09 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.41]). No patient receiving C_C044834 had an increase of 1.0 mg per deciliter or more, but 10 patients in the C_D007472 group (15 percent) did. The mean change in the C_D003404 concentration from day 0 to day 7 was 0.07 mg per deciliter in the C_C044834 group and 0.24 mg per deciliter in the C_D007472 group (P=0.003; value in the C_C044834 group minus the value in the C_D007472 group, -0.17 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.34 to -0.07]). CONCLUSIONS: D_D007674 induced by contrast medium may be less likely to develop in high-risk patients when C_C044834 is used rather than a low-osmolar, nonionic contrast medium.

title:Experimental cranial D_D010146 elicited by C_D002211: a PET study.
abstract:Using a positron emission tomography (PET) study it was shown recently that in D_D008881 without aura certain areas in the brain stem were activated during the D_D006261 state, but not in the D_D006261 free interval. It was suggested that this brain stem activation is inherent to the D_D008881 attack itself and represents the so called 'D_D008881 generator'. To test this hypothesis we performed an experimental D_D010146 study in seven healthy volunteers, using the same positioning in the PET scanner as in the D_D008881 patients. A small amount of C_D002211 was administered subcutaneously in the right forehead to evoke a burning D_D010146ful sensation in the first division of the trigeminal nerve. Increases of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were found bilaterally in the insula, in the anterior cingulate cortex, the cavernous sinus and the cerebellum. Using the same stereotactic space limits as in the above mentioned D_D008881 study no brain stem activation was found in the acute D_D010146 state compared to the D_D010146 free state. The increase of activation in the region of the cavernous sinus however, suggests that this structure is more likely to be involved in trigeminal transmitted D_D010146 as such, rather than in a specific type of D_D006261 as was suggested for cluster D_D006261.

title:D_D009459 with C_D018967.
abstract:D_D009459 is thought to be a result of C_D004298 D2 receptor blockade in the striatum of the basal ganglia. C_D018967, a C_C441200 derivative antipsychotic, has high C_D012701 5-HT2 receptor blockade and dose-related D2 receptor blockade. The high ratio is believed to impart the low frequency of D_D001480 with C_D018967 at low dosages. With this low frequency of D_D001480, it was thought the frequency of D_D009459 might also be lowered. A 73-year-old woman developed D_D009459 after monotherapy with C_D018967. The syndrome reversed after discontinuing C_D018967 and starting treatment with C_D003620 and C_D001971. It appears that the protection from extrapyramidal side effects observed with C_D018967 does not ensure protection from D_D009459.

title:Hepatic and extrahepatic C_D000809ogen gene expression in rats with acute D_D009404.
abstract:Plasma concentration and urine excretion of the renin-C_D000809 system proteins are altered in rats with D_D009404 (D_D009404). In this work the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels of C_D000809ogen (Ao) were analyzed with the slot-blot hybridization technique in liver and other extrahepatic tissues: kidney, heart, brain, and adrenal gland from control, D_D009404, and pair-fed (PF) rats. D_D009404 was induced by a single injection of C_D011692 (C_D011692). Although a great urinary excretion and half-normal plasma levels of Ao were observed on day 6 after C_D011692 injection, when D_D009404 was clearly established, hepatic Ao mRNA levels did not change. Furthermore, the Ao mRNA levels did not change in any of the extrahepatic tissues studied on day 6, nor did its hepatic levels at days 1, 3, 5, or 7 after C_D011692 injection. These data suggest that the hepatic and extrahepatic Ao mRNA levels are unaltered during the development of the acute D_D009404 induced by C_D011692.

title:C_D003520 associated D_D001749--a highly aggressive disease: analysis of 12 cases.
abstract:PURPOSE: We gained knowledge of the etiology, treatment and prevention of C_D003520 associated D_D014523. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of 6 men and 6 women (mean age 55 years) with C_D003520 associated D_D001749 were reviewed. RESULTS: All D_D009369 were grade 3 or 4 transitional cell D_D002277. Of the 5 patients initially treated with endoscopic resection alone only 1 is alive without disease. Of the 6 patients who underwent early cystectomy 4 were alive at 24 to 111 months. The remaining patient with extensive D_D009369 underwent partial cystectomy for palliation and died 3 months later. CONCLUSIONS: C_D003520 associated D_D001749 is an aggressive disease. However, long-term survival is possible when radical cystectomy is performed for bladder D_D009369 with any sign of invasion and for recurrent high grade disease, even when noninvasive.

title:D_D001416 after spinal anaesthesia involving hyperbaric 5% C_D008012.
abstract:Fifty-four patients, aged 27-90 years, who were given C_D008012 5% in 6.8% C_D005947 solution for spinal anaesthesia were studied. Thirteen of these patients experienced D_D001416 after recovery from anaesthesia. The patients affected were younger (p < 0.05) and the site of the dural puncture was higher (p < 0.01) than those individuals without D_D010146. Five of the 13 patients (38%) with D_D010146 and seven of the 41 patients (17%) without D_D010146 admitted to a high C_D000431 intake, which might be a contributing factor. Leg and/or back D_D010146 is associated with the intrathecal use of hyperbaric 5% C_D008012.

title:Acute blood pressure elevations with C_D002110 in men with borderline systemic D_D006973.
abstract:Whether the vasoconstrictive actions of C_D002110 are enhanced in D_D006973 persons has not been demonstrated. Thus, C_D002110 (3.3 mg/kg) versus placebo was tested in 48 healthy men (aged 20 to 35 years) selected after screening on 2 separate occasions. Borderline D_D006973 men (n = 24) were selected with screening systolic blood pressure (BP) of 140 to 160 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP 90 to 99 mm Hg. Low-risk controls (n = 24) reported no parental history of D_D006973 and had screening BP < 130/85 mm Hg. Participants were then tested on 2 occasions after 12-hour abstinence from C_D002110 in each of 2 protocols; this required a total of 4 laboratory visits. C_D002110-induced changes in diastolic BP were 2 to 3 times larger in borderline subjects than in controls (+8.4 vs +3.8 mm Hg, p < 0.0001), and were attributable to larger changes in impedance-derived measures of systemic vascular resistance (+135 vs +45 dynes.s.cm-5, p < 0.004). These findings were consistent and reached significance in both protocols. The percentage of borderline subjects in whom diastolic BP changes exceeded the median control response was 96%. Consequently, whereas all participants exhibited normotensive levels during the resting predrug baseline, 33% of borderline subjects achieved D_D006973 BP levels after C_D002110 ingestion. Thus, in borderline D_D006973 men, exaggerated responses to C_D002110 were: selective for diastolic BP, consistent with greater vasoconstriction, replicated in 2 protocols, and representative of nearly all borderline D_D006973s. We suspect that the potential for C_D002110 to stabilize high resistance states in susceptible persons suggests that its use may facilitate their disease progression, as well as hinder accurate diagnosis and treatment.

title:D_D006212 and C_D007069-induced D_D020258.
abstract:BACKGROUND: D_D006212 as a symptom of central D_D020258 are a known but poorly described side effect of C_D007069. Most cases of C_D007069-induced D_D006212 have been reported with other mental status changes. METHODS: The authors interviewed six persons with C_D007069-induced D_D006212 in the presence of a clear sensorium. All patients were receiving high-dose C_D007069 as part of their bone marrow transplant procedure. RESULTS: D_D006212 occurred only when the patient's eyes were closed and, in all but one case, were reported as disturbing or frightening. Underreporting of these D_D006212 by patients is likely. CONCLUSIONS: D_D006212 may be the sole or first manifestation of D_D020258. The incidence may be dose and infusion-time related. The clinician should be alerted for possible C_D007069-induced D_D006212, which may occur without other signs of D_D020258. "Eyes-closed" D_D006212 experiences appear to be an unusual feature of this presentation. Patients anxious about this experience respond well to support and education about this occurrence. Optimal pharmacologic management of disturbed patients is unclear. If D_D011595 becomes marked, high-potency neuroleptics (i.e., C_D006220) may be effective.

D_D014786 occurs in D_D003920 for a variety of reasons, and accurate diagnosis is necessary to institute appropriate therapy. The possibility of a drug-induced D_D009901 should be considered in the differential diagnosis of D_D014786 in D_D003920.

title:Factors associated with D_D007674 and clinical outcome in patients receiving C_D000583.
abstract:Data from 60 patients treated with C_D000583 were analyzed for factors associated with D_D007674. In 42 of these patients, data were examined for factors associated with clinical outcome. Variables evaluated included patient weight, age, sex, serum C_D003404 level, C_D003404 clearance, duration of therapy, total dose, mean daily dose, organism minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), mean peak levels, mean trough levels, mean area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC), total AUC, mean AUC greater than MIC, total AUC greater than MIC, mean Schumacher's intensity factor (IF), total IF, In (mean maximum concentration [Cmax]/MIC). Model-dependent pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by computer based on a one-compartment model. When the parameters were examined individually, duration of therapy and total AUC correlated significantly (P less than .05) with D_D007674. In contrast, a stepwise discriminant function analysis identified only duration of therapy (P less than .001) as an important factor. Based on this model and on Bayes' theorem, the predictive accuracy of identifying "D_D007674" patients increased from 0.17 to 0.39. When examined individually, mean IF, MIC, total dose, mean daily dose, and ln (mean Cmax/MIC) correlated significantly (P less than .05) with cure. In contrast, a simultaneous multivariable analysis identified IF, MIC, and total dose according to one model and ln (mean Cmax/MIC) according to a second statistical model of parameters selected to have the greatest prospective value. Based on Bayes' theorem and the first model, the predictive accuracy of identifying patients not cured increased from 0.19 to 0.83. For the second model, the predictive accuracy increased from 0.19 to 0.50.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

title:Cardiac transplantation: improved quality of survival with a modified immunosuppressive protocol.
abstract:The effects on renal function on two different immunosuppressive protocols were evaluated retrospectively in two subsequent groups of heart transplant recipients. In group I, C_D016572 was given before the procedure at a loading dose of 17.5 mg/kg and then continued after the procedure to keep a whole blood level about 1000 ng/ml. In group II, C_D016572 was started only after the procedure at a lower dosage and was complemented by C_D001379, which was used for the first postoperative week. Group II showed a better perioperative renal function as determined by serum blood C_D001806 and serum C_D003404 levels. Group II also showed a significant decrease of chronic D_D007674 secondary to long-term therapy with C_D016572. Despite this improvement in late renal function, group II still shows a slow rise in serum C_D003404. We think that even these lower dosages of C_D016572 can cause chronic D_D007674 and that further modification of the immunosuppressive regimen is required to completely abolish this toxic side effect.

Liver biopsy showed D_D002779 with both cytological and architectural alterations of interlobular bile ducts. C_D001379 withdrawal resulted after 7 weeks in the resolution of clinical and biochemical abnormalities. It is believed that this is the first reported case of reversible C_D001379-induced D_D002779 associated with histological evidence of D_D002779.

title:Renal function and hemodynamics during prolonged C_D007530-induced D_D007022 in humans.
abstract:The effect of C_D007530-induced D_D007022 on glomerular function and renal blood flow was investigated in 20 human subjects. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were measured by inulin and C_D010130 (C_D010130) clearance, respectively. Anesthesia was maintained with C_D005283, C_D009609, C_D010100, and C_D007530. D_D007022 was induced for 236.9 +/- 15.1 min by increasing the C_D007530 inspired concentration to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 59.8 +/- 0.4 mmHg. GFR and ERPF decreased with the induction of anesthesia but not significantly more during D_D007022. Postoperatively, ERPF returned to preoperative values, whereas GFR was higher than preoperative values. Renal vascular resistance increased during anesthesia but decreased when D_D007022 was induced, allowing the maintenance of renal blood flow. We conclude that renal compensatory mechanisms are preserved during C_D007530-induced D_D007022 and that renal function and hemodynamics quickly return to normal when normotension is resumed.

title:C_D003647 phenotype and the pharmacokinetics and beta-2 receptor pharmacodynamics of C_D008790 and its enantiomers.
abstract:The metabolism of the cardioselective beta-blocker C_D008790 is under genetic control of the C_D003647/C_D013034 type. The two metabolic phenotypes, extensive (EM) and poor metabolizers (PM), show different stereoselective metabolism, resulting in apparently higher beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonistic potency of racemic C_D008790 in EMs. We investigated if the latter also applies to the beta-2 adrenoceptor antagonism by C_D008790. The drug effect studied was the antagonism by C_D008790 of C_D013726-induced D_D007008. By using pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic modeling the pharmacodynamics of racemic C_D008790 and the active S-isomer, were quantitated in EMs and PMs in terms of IC50 values, representing C_D008790 plasma concentrations resulting in half-maximum receptor occupancy. Six EMs received 0.5 mg of C_D013726 s.c. on two different occasions: 1) 1 hr after administration of a placebo and 2) 1 hr after 150 mg of C_D008790 p.o. Five PMs were studied according to the same protocol, except for a higher C_D013726 dose (0.75 mg) on day 2. Blood samples for the analysis of plasma C_D011188, C_D013726, C_D008790 (racemic, R- and S-isomer), and alpha-hydroxyC_D008790 concentrations were taken at regular time intervals, during 8 hr after C_D008790. In PMs, C_D008790 increased the C_D013726 area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve (+67%). Higher C_D008790/alpha-hydroxyC_D008790 ratios in PMs were predictive for higher R-/S-isomer ratios of unchanged drug. There was a difference in C_D008790 potency with higher racemic C_D008790 IC50 values in PMs (72 +/- 7 ng.ml-1) than EMs (42 +/- 8 ng.ml-1, P less than .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

abstract:Immune D_D000743 due to a drug-adsorption mechanism has been described primarily in patients receiving C_D010406 and first-generation C_D002511. We describe a patient who developed D_D000740 while receiving intravenous C_D015313. C_D015313-dependent antibodies were detected in the patient's serum and in an eluate prepared from his red blood cells. The eluate also reacted weakly with red blood cells in the absence of C_D015313, suggesting the concomitant formation of warm-reactive autoantibodies. These observations, in conjunction with clinical and laboratory evidence of extravascular D_D006461, are consistent with drug-induced D_D000743, possibly involving both drug-adsorption and autoantibody formation mechanisms. This case emphasizes the need for increased awareness of hemolytic reactions to all C_D002511.

title:D_D058186 subsequent to the administration of C_D012293. A follow-up study of cases reported earlier.
abstract:A clinical presentation is made of a 2-3 year follow-up of six cases of D_D058186 that have been reported earlier. The patients had developed transient D_D051437 after the intermittent administration of C_D012293. The stage of olig-D_D001002 lasted for 1-3 weeks, and five of the patients were treated by hemodialysis. Two of the patients died due to unrelated causes during the follow-up period. The four patients re-examined were clinically cured. Pathologic findings by light microscopy and immunofluorescence at biopsy were scarce. Nothing abnormal was seen by electron microscopy in two of the cases studied. Renal function was normal. In three cases the excretion at 131I-hippuran renography was slightly slowed. Although in the acute stage the D_D007674 histologically appeared toxic, evidence suggestive of an immunological mechanism cannot be excluded.

title:D_D006509 after needle-stick exposure: prevention with D_D006509 immune globulin. Final report of the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study.
abstract:D_D006509 immune globulin (HBIG) and immune serum globulin (ISG) were examined in a randomized, double-blind trial to assess their relative efficacies in preventing D_D006509 after needle-stick exposure to D_D006509 surface antigen (C_D006514)-positive donors. Clinical D_D056486 developed in 1.4% of HBIG and in 5.9% of ISG recipients (P = 0.016), and seroconversion (anti-HBs) occurred in 5.6% and 20.7% of them respectively (P less than 0.001). Mild and transient side-effects were noted in 3.0% of ISG and in 3.2% of HBIG recipients. Available donor sera were examined for DNA polymerase (DNAP) and e antigen and antibody (C_D006513; anti-HBE). Both DNAP and C_D006513 showed a highly statistically significant correlation with the infectivity of C_D006514-positive donors. D_D006509 immune globulin remained significantly superior to ISG in preventing D_D006509 even when the analysis was confined to these two high-risk subgroups. The efficacy of ISG in preventing D_D006509 cannot be ascertained because a true placebo group was not included.

title:D_D020230 from C_C047426-C_D014191 interaction.
abstract:Excessive stimulation of C_D012701 5HT1A receptors causes a syndrome of C_D012701 excess that consists of shivering, D_D009127, D_D012798, D_D003221, D_D011595 and D_D005334. The most common cause of this syndrome is an interaction between a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and a specific C_D012701 reuptake inhibitor. C_C047426 is a new antidepressant agent that inhibits the reuptake of C_D012701 and C_D009638. We report a C_C047426-MAOI interaction that resulted in the C_D012701 syndrome in a 23-y-old male who was taking C_D014191 for D_D003866. He had been well until the morning of presentation when he took 1/2 tab of C_C047426. Within 2 h he became confused with jerking movements of his extremities, D_D014202 and D_D009127. He was brought directly to a hospital where he was found to be agitated and confused with shivering, D_D009207, D_D009127, D_D012798 and diaphoresis. His pupils were 7 mm and sluggishly reactive to light. Vital signs were: blood pressure 120/67 mm Hg, heart rate 127/min, respiratory rate 28/min, and temperature 97 F. After 180 mg of C_D003975 i.v. he remained tremulous with D_D009127 and clenched jaws. He was intubated for airway protection and because of D_D007040, and was D_D010243 to control D_D009127. His subsequent course was remarkable for non-immune D_D013921 which resolved. The patient's maximal temperature was 101.2 F and his CPK remained < 500 units/L with no other evidence of D_D012206. His mental status normalized and he was transferred to a psychiatry ward. This patient survived without sequelae due to the aggressive sedation and neuromuscular D_D010243.

title:Effect of nonC_D004298rgic drugs on C_D007980-induced D_D004409 in C_D015632-treated monkeys.
abstract:A group of four monkeys was rendered D_D020734 with the toxin C_D015632. They were then treated chronically with C_C005177 50/12.5 mg/kg given orally daily for 2 months. This dose produced a striking antiD_D020734 effect, but all animals manifested D_D004409. A series of agents acting primarily on neurotransmitters other than C_D004298 were then tested in combination with C_D007980 to see if the D_D004409 movements would be modified. Several drugs, including C_D003000, C_D010830, C_D008784, C_-1, C_D011433, and C_D016291, markedly reduced the D_D004409 movements but at the cost of a return of D_D020734 symptomatology. However, C_D015016 and C_D008614 reduced predominantly the D_D004409 movements. C_D001418 was also useful in one monkey against a more D_D020821 form of D_D004409. C_D001285 converted the D_D020821 movements into D_D002819.

title:C_D008130 (C_D008130) D_D064420 in dogs: a retrospective study (2002-07).
abstract:OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence of haematological, renal, hepatic and gastrointestinal toxicities in tumour-bearing dogs receiving C_D008130 (C_D008130). DESIGN: The medical records of 206 dogs that were treated with C_D008130 at the Melbourne Veterinary Specialist Centre between February 2002 and December 2007 were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 206 dogs treated with C_D008130, 185 met the inclusion criteria for at least one class of D_D064420. C_D008130 was used most commonly in the treatment of D_D008223, D_D034801, D_D001932, D_D015620 and epitheliotropic D_D008223. Throughout treatment, 56.9% of dogs experienced D_D009503, 34.2% experienced D_D000740 and 14.2% experienced D_D013921. D_D005767 was detected in 37.8% of dogs, the most common sign of which was D_D014839 (24.3%). Potential renal D_D064420 and elevated C_D000409 transaminase (ALT) concentration were reported in 12.2% and 48.8% of dogs, respectively. The incidence of D_D017093 was 1.2%. CONCLUSIONS: C_D008130-associated D_D064420 in dogs is common, but is usually not life threatening.

title:Neuroactive C_D013256 protect against C_D010862- and C_D007608-induced limbic D_D012640 and D_D013226 in mice.
abstract:Several structurally related metabolites of C_D011374 (C_D011374) and C_D003900 (C_D003900) and their 3 beta-epimers were evaluated for protective activity against C_D010862-, C_D007608- and C_D016202 (C_D016202)-induced D_D012640 in mice. C_D013256 with the 3-hydroxy group in the alpha-position and 5-H in the alpha- or beta-configurations were highly effective in protecting against C_D010862 (416 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced limbic motor D_D012640 and D_D013226 (ED50 values, 7.0-18.7 mg/kg, i.p.). The corresponding epimers with the 3-hydroxy group in the beta-position were also effective but less potent (ED50 values, 33.8-63.5, i.p.). Although the neuroactive C_D013256 were considerably less potent than the C_D001569 C_D002998 in protecting against C_D010862 D_D012640, C_D013256 with the 5 alpha,3 alpha-configuration had comparable or higher protective index values (TD50 for motor impairment divided by ED50 for D_D012640 protection) than C_D002998, indicating that some neuroactive C_D013256 may have lower relative D_D064420. C_D013256 with the 5 alpha,3 alpha- or 5 beta,3 alpha-configurations also produced a dose-dependent delay in the onset of limbic D_D012640 induced by C_D007608 (32 mg/kg, s.c.), but did not completely protect against the D_D012640. However, when a second dose of the C_D013256 was administered 1 hr after the first dose, complete protection from the C_D007608-induced limbic D_D012640 and D_D013226 was obtained. The C_D013256 also caused a dose-dependent delay in C_D016202 (257 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced lethality, but did not completely protect against C_D016202 D_D012640 or lethality. We conclude that neuroactive C_D013256 are highly effective in protecting against C_D010862- and C_D007608-induced D_D012640 and D_D013226 in mice, and may be of utility in the treatment of some forms of D_D013226 in humans.

title:The safety and efficacy of combination C_C059896 (C_C059896) and C_D015215 in patients with D_D015658 and 200-500 CD4 cells/mm3.
abstract:We conducted a double-blind, randomized phase II study to evaluate the safety and activity of combination therapy with C_C059896 (C_C059896) (an alpha-glucosidase I inhibitor) and C_D015215 versus C_D015215 alone. Patients with 200 to 500 CD4 cells/mm3 who tolerated < or = 12 weeks of prior C_D015215 therapy received C_C059896 (1000 mg every 8 h) and C_D015215 (100 mg every 8 h) or C_D015215 and placebo. Sixty patients received combination therapy and 58, C_D015215 and placebo. Twenty-three patients (38%) and 15 (26%), in the combination and C_D015215 groups, respectively, discontinued therapy (p = 0.15). The mean C_C059896 steady-state trough level (4.04 +/- 0.99 micrograms/ml) was below the in vitro inhibitory concentration for human D_D007153 virus (HIV). The mean increase in CD4 cells at week 4 was 73.8 cells/mm3 and 52.4 cells/mm3 for the combination and C_D015215 groups, respectively (p > 0.36). For patients with prior C_D015215 therapy, the mean change in CD4 cells in the combination and C_D015215 groups was 63.7 cells/mm3 and 4.9 cells/mm3 at week 8 and 6.8 cells/mm3 and -45.1 cells/mm3 at week 16, respectively. The number of patients with suppression of HIV p24 antigenemia in the combination and C_D015215 groups was six (40%) and two (11%) at week 4 (p = 0.10) and five (45%) and two (14%) at week 24 (p = 0.08), respectively. D_D003967, D_D005414, D_D015746, and D_D015431 were common for combination recipients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

title:Recent preclinical and clinical studies with the thymidylate synthase inhibitor C_C031662 (C_C031662).
abstract:C_C031662, C_C031662, is a tight-binding inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (TS) whose D_D064420 is mediated solely through the inhibition of this enzyme. Recent preclinical studies have focused on the intracellular formation of C_C031662 polyglutamates. Following a 12-hour exposure of L1210 cells to 50 microM [3H]C_C031662, 30% of the extractable radioactivity could be accounted for as C_C031662 tetra- and pentaglutamate, as determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses. As inhibitors of isolated L1210 TS, C_C031662 di-, tri-, tetra- and pentaglutamate are 26-, 87-, 119- and 114-fold more potent than C_C031662, respectively, and their formation may, therefore, be an important determinant of C_C031662 D_D064420. In early clinical studies with C_C031662, activity has been seen in D_D001943, D_D010051, D_D006528, and D_D008654. D_D064420 included D_D056486, D_D005221, and dose-limiting D_D007674. This latter effect is thought to be due to drug precipitation within the renal tubule as a result of the poor solubility of C_C031662 under acidic conditions. In an attempt to overcome this problem, a clinical trial of C_C031662 administered with alkaline diuresis is under way. Preliminary results at 400 and 500 mg/m2 suggest that a reduction in D_D007674 may have been achieved with only 1 instance of D_D007674 in 10 patients. D_D056486 and D_D005221 are again the most frequent side effects. Evidence of antitumor activity has been seen in 3 patients. Pharmacokinetic investigations have shown that alkaline diuresis does not alter C_C031662 plasma levels or urinary excretion and that satisfactory urinary alkalinization can be readily achieved.

title:C_C084820 and C_D001590 in neuroleptic-induced D_D010302.
abstract:In a 12-week controlled study C_C084820 was compared to C_D001590 in the treatment of D_D010302 induced by C_C017610 in 60 D_D012559 outpatients. C_C084820 and C_D001590 were found to be equally effective in controlling D_D010302 and were as efficacious as C_D011352, their previous antiparkinsonian drug. However, C_D001590 treated patients had a significant increase in D_D004409 compared to their condition during C_D011352 treatment, and significantly more D_D001008 and D_D003866 than C_C084820 treated patients. This suggests that C_D001590 is not the anticholinergic drug of choice in the treatment of neuroleptic-induced D_D010302, because of its more toxic central and peripheral atropinic effect.

title:Effect of C_D024502 and C_D003676 on C_D008694-induced D_D020258.
abstract:C_D008694 (C_D008694)-induced C_D004298rgic D_D020258 is believed to be associated with the increased formation of free radicals. This study examined the effect of C_D024502 (C_D024502), a scavenger of reactive C_D010100 species, and C_D003676 (C_D003676), an C_D007501 chelator, on the C_D008694-induced D_D020258. Male rats were treated with C_D008694 (10 mg/kg, every 2 h for four injections). The rat received either C_D024502 (20 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 3 days and 30 min prior to C_D008694 administration or C_D003676 (50 mg/kg) subcutaneously 30 min before C_D008694 administration. The concentrations of C_D004298 (C_D004298), C_D012701 and their metabolites decreased significantly after C_D008694 administration, which was inhibited by the C_D024502 and C_D003676 pretreatment. C_D024502 and C_D003676 attenuated the C_D008694-induced D_D005334 as well as the alterations in the locomotor activity. The level of lipid peroxidation was higher and the reduced C_D005978 concentration was lower in the C_D008694-treated rats. These changes were significantly attenuated by C_D024502 and C_D003676. This suggests that C_D024502 and C_D003676 ameliorate the C_D008694-induced D_D009422 by decreasing the level of oxidative stress.

title:Use of C_D003907 with C_D015080 for the prevention of C_D007069-induced hemorrhagic cystitis.
abstract:AIM: Hemorrhagic cystitis (D_D006470|D003556) is a limiting side-effect of chemotherapy with C_D007069 (C_D007069). In the study presented here, we investigated the use of C_D003907 in combination with C_D015080 for the prevention of C_D007069-induced D_D006470|D003556. METHODS: Male Wistar rats (150-200 g; 6 rats per group) were treated with saline or C_D015080 5 min (i.p.) before and 2 and 6 h after (v.o.) administration of C_D007069. One, two or three doses of C_D015080 were replaced with C_D003907 alone or with C_D003907 plus C_D015080. D_D003556 was evaluated 24 h after its induction by the changes in bladder wet weight and by macroscopic and microscopic analysis. RESULTS: The replacement of the last dose or the last two doses of C_D015080 with C_D003907 reduced the increase in bladder wet weight induced by C_D007069 by 84.79% and 89.13%, respectively. In addition, it almost abolished the macroscopic and microscopic alterations induced by C_D007069. Moreover, the addition of C_D003907 to the last two doses of C_D015080 was more efficient than three doses of C_D015080 alone when evaluated microscopically. CONCLUSION: C_D003907 in combination with C_D015080 was efficient in blocking C_D007069-induced D_D006470|D003556. However, the replacement of last two doses of C_D015080 with saline or all of the C_D015080 doses with C_D003907 did not prevent D_D006470|D003556.

title:Behavioral effects of C_D016291 on C_D012110-treated mice.
abstract:The effects of C_D016291 (C_D016291), a noncompetitive C_D016202 (C_D016202) receptor antagonist, were studied on C_D004298-related behaviors induced by C_D012110 treatments. This study focuses on behavioral syndromes that may used as models for D_D010300, or D_D004409, and its response after glutamatergic blockage. C_D012110 (1 mg/kg), administered once every other day for 4 days, produced increases in D_D009069, tongue protrusion and vacuous chewing in mice, which are signs indicative of D_D004409. C_D012110 also produced D_D014202 and D_D002375, which are signs suggestive of D_D010300. C_D016291 (0.1 mg/kg), administered 30 min before the observation test, prevented the vacuous chewing movements, tongue protrusions and D_D002375 induced by C_D012110. However, C_D016291 injection produced a significant increase of D_D014202 in C_D012110-treated mice. C_D012110 (1 mg/kg), administered 90 min before the test and followed by C_D001058 injection (0.1 mg/kg) 5 min before the test, did not produce D_D009069 in mice. On the other hand, C_D012110 induced increases in D_D014202 and D_D002375 compared to control mice. C_D016291 (0.1 mg/kg) administration attenuated the D_D002375 and D_D014202 induced by C_D012110. Pretreatment with C_D012110 (1 mg/kg) 24 h before the observation test produced increases in vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusion, as well as increases in D_D014202 and D_D002375, whereas C_D016291 (0.1 mg/kg) injection 90 min before the test reversed the effects of C_D012110. These results show that C_D012110 produces different and D_D004409, which are related to dose and schedule employed and can be considered as D_D010300-like and D_D004409 signs. The glutamatergic blockage produced by C_D016202 can restore these signs, such as vacuous chewing movements, tongue protrusions, D_D002375 and D_D014202 according to the employed model.

abstract:OBJECTIVE: In this study the effect of C_D005996 on the C_D009388-C_D009020-induced sphincter of Oddi D_D013035 was evaluated in nine female patients with D_D046628. METHOD: Sphincter of Oddi D_D013035 was induced by C_D009388-C_D009020 administration (0.5 mg C_D009388 intramuscularly and 10 mg C_D009020 subcutaneously) and visualized by quantitative hepatobiliary scintigraphy. The entire procedure was repeated during C_D005996 infusion (C_D005996 1 microg/kg/min for 120 min). RESULTS: C_D009388-C_D009020 provocation caused significant increases in the time to peak activity (Tmax) over the hepatic hilum (HH: 34.33 +/- 5.05 vs. 22.77 +/- 3.26) and the common bile duct (CBD: 60.44 +/- 5.99 vs. 40.0 +/- 2.88) and in the half-time of excretion (T1/2) over the liver parenchyma (LP: 120.04 +/- 16.01 vs. 27.37 +/- 2.19), HH (117.61 +/- 14.71 vs. 31.85 +/- 3.99) and CBD (158.11 +/- 9.18 vs. 40.1 +/- 6.24), indicating a complete D_D013035 at the level of the sphincter of Oddi. C_D005996 infusion completely normalized the C_D009388-C_D009020-induced alterations in these quantitative parameters (TmaX over the LP: 11.33 +/- 1.13; over the HH: 18.88 +/- 1.48; and over the CBD: 36.22 +/- 1.92; and T1/2 over the LP: 28.21 +/- 1.83; over the HH: 33.42 +/- 3.10; and over the CBD: 41.66 +/- 6.33), suggesting an effective sphincter-relaxing effect of C_D005996. CONCLUSION: These results provide the first evidence of the effectiveness of C_D005996 on the C_D009020-induced sphincter of Oddi D_D013035 in humans. Since C_D005996 is able to overcome even the drastic effect of C_D009020, it might be of relevance in the treatment of D_D046628.

title:Effects of acute C_D013256 administration on ventilatory and peripheral muscles in rats.
abstract:Occasional case reports have shown that acute D_D009135 may occur in patients treated with massive doses of corticoC_D013256s. C_D014221he mechanism of this D_D009135 is poorly understood. C_D014221herefore, 60 male rats were randomly assigned to receive daily injection of saline (C), C_D008775 (C_D008775), or C_D014221 (C_D014221) 80 mg/kg/d for 5 d. Nutritional intake, measured daily in 15 animals, showed a significant D_D000855 in the C_D013256-treated groups (-50 and -79% in C_D008775 and C_D014221, respectively). C_D014221his was associated with a similar D_D015431. In the 45 remaining animals, diaphragm contractility and histopathologic features of several muscles were studied. Weights of respiratory and peripheral muscles were similarly decreased after C_D013256 treatment. C_D008775aximal twitches of the diaphragm were lower in the C group (653 +/- 174 g/cm(2)) than in the C_D008775 group (837 +/- 171 g/cm(2); p < 0.05) and the C_D014221 group (765 +/- 145 g/cm(2), NS). Half-relaxation time was prolonged in both C_D013256 groups, and time to peak tension was longer with C_D008775, whereas D_D013746 tensions were similar. C_D013256 treatment also induced a leftward shift of the force-frequency curve at 25 and 50 Hz when compared with saline treatment (p < 0.05). AC_D014221Pase staining of the diaphragm, scalenus medius, and gastrocnemius showed type IIb fiber D_D009133 in the C_D013256 groups and also diaphragmatic type IIa D_D009133 with C_D014221, whereas histologic examinations revealed a normal muscular pattern with absence of D_D009336. Finally, a pair-fed (PF) study, performed in 18 rats (C, C_D014221, and PF), showed that muscle D_D009133 was considerably less pronounced in PF animals than in C_D014221-treated animals. We conclude that (1) short-term treatment with massive doses of C_D013256s induced severe respiratory and limb muscle wasting; (2) both types of C_D013256s induced predominantly type IIb D_D009133, resulting in the expected alterations in diaphragm contractile properties; (3) neither C_D013256 caused muscle D_D009336; (4) type IIb D_D009133 was not caused by acute nutritional deprivation alone.

abstract:A seventy-eight-year-old woman presented with complete D_D006327 and refractory D_D007022 two days after a therapeutic dose of sustained-release C_D014700 with concomitant use of C_D008790. The patient continued to remain D_D007022 with complete D_D006327, even with multiple uses of intravenous C_D001285 as well as high doses of pressor agents such as C_D004298 and C_D004280. However, shortly after the use of intravenous C_D002122, the refractory D_D007022 and complete D_D006327 resolved.

title:A phase I clinical study of the C_D000983 antiC_D005492 C_C045894 (C_C045894) given with oral C_D005492.
abstract:C_C045894 is an antiC_D005492 which inhibits C_C402896 formyltransferase (GARFT), an enzyme essential for de novo C_D011687 synthesis. Extensive experimental and limited clinical data have shown that C_C045894 has activity against D_D009369 which are refractory to other drugs, notably C_D008727. However, the initial clinical development of C_C045894 was curtailed because of severe and cumulative antiproliferative D_D064420. Preclinical murine studies demonstrated that the D_D064420 of C_C045894 can be prevented by low dose C_D005492 administration, i.e. for 7 days prior to and 7 days following a single bolus dose. This observation prompted a Phase I clinical study of C_C045894 given with C_D005492 supplementation which has confirmed that the D_D064420 of C_C045894 can be markedly reduced by C_D005492 supplementation. D_D013921 and D_D052016 were the major D_D064420. There was no clear relationship between clinical D_D064420 and the extent of plasma C_D005492 elevation. Associated studies demonstrated that C_C045894 plasma pharmacokinetics were not altered by C_D005492 administration indicating that supplementation is unlikely to reduce D_D064420 by enhancing C_C045894 plasma clearance. The work described in this report has identified for the first time a clinically acceptable schedule for the administration of a GARFT inhibitor. This information will facilitate the future evaluation of this class of compounds in D_D009369 therapy.

title:Involvement of the mu-opiate receptor in peripheral D_D000699.
abstract:The intradermal injection of mu (C_D009020, C_D020875 and C_C028889), kappa (C_D019900) and delta (C_D020881 and C_C034318) selective opioid-agonists, by themselves, did not significantly affect the mechanical nociceptive threshold in the hindpaw of the rat. Intradermal injection of mu, but not delta or kappa opioid-agonists, however, produced dose-dependent inhibition of C_D015232-induced D_D006930. The analgesic effect of the mu-agonist C_D009020 was dose-dependently antagonized by C_D009270 and prevented by co-injection of pertussis toxin. C_D009020 did not, however, alter the D_D006930 induced by C_D015124. We conclude that the analgesic action of opioids on the peripheral terminals of primary afferents is via a binding site with characteristics of the mu-opioid receptor and that this action is mediated by inhibition of the C_D000242 second messenger system.

title:Adequate timing of C_D012254 reduction in patients with D_D006461 during combination therapy of C_D007372 and C_D012254 for D_D019698.
abstract:BACKGROUND: D_D000743 is one of the major adverse events of the combination therapy of C_D007372 and C_D012254. Because of C_D012254-related D_D000743, dose reduction is a common event in this therapy. In this clinical retrospective cohort study we have examined the suitable timing of C_D012254 reduction in patients with D_D006461 during combination therapy. METHODS: Thirty-seven of 160 patients who had HCV-genotype 1b, had high virus load, and received 24-week combination therapy developed D_D000740 with hemoglobin level <10 g/dl or D_D000740-related signs during therapy. After that, these 37 patients were reduced one tablet of C_D012254 (200 mg) per day. After reduction of C_D012254, 27 of 37 patients could continue combination therapy for a total of 24 weeks (group A). However, 10 of 37 patients with reduction of C_D012254 could not continue combination therapy because their <8.5 g/dl hemoglobin values decreased to or D_D000740-related severe side effects occurred (group B). We assessed the final efficacy and safety after reduction of C_D012254 in groups A and B. RESULTS: A sustained virological response (SVR) was 29.6% (8/27) in group A and 10% (1/10) in group B, respectively. A 34.4% (12/27) of SVR + biological response in group A was higher than 10% (1/10) in group B ( P = 0.051), with slight significance. With respect to hemoglobin level at the time of C_D012254 reduction, a rate of continuation of therapy in patients with > or =10 g/dl hemoglobin was higher than that in patients with <10 g/dl ( P = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of C_D012254 at hemoglobin level > or =10 g/dl is suitable in terms of efficacy and side effects.

title:Increased expression and apical targeting of renal EC_D012964C subunits in C_D011692-induced D_D009404 in rats.
abstract:D_D009404 is often accompanied by C_D012964 retention and generalized D_D004487. C_D006859owever, the molecular basis for the decreased renal C_D012964 excretion remains undefined. We hypothesized that epithelial C_D012964 channel (EC_D012964C) subunit dysregulation may be responsible for the increased C_D012964 retention. An experimental group of rats was treated with C_D011692 (C_D011692; 180 mg/kg iv), whereas the control group received only vehicle. After 7 days, C_D011692 treatment induced significant D_D011507, D_D034141, decreased urinary C_D012964 excretion, and extensive D_D001201. The protein abundance of alpha-EC_D012964C and beta-EC_D012964C was increased in the inner stripe of the outer medulla (ISOM) and in the inner medulla (IM) but was not altered in the cortex. gamma-EC_D012964C abundance was increased in the cortex, ISOM, and IM. Immunoperoxidase brightfield- and laser-scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy demonstrated increased targeting of alpha-EC_D012964C, beta-EC_D012964C, and gamma-EC_D012964C subunits to the apical plasma membrane in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT2), connecting tubule, and cortical and medullary collecting duct segments. Immunoelectron microscopy further revealed an increased labeling of alpha-EC_D012964C in the apical plasma membrane of cortical collecting duct principal cells of C_D011692-treated rats, indicating enhanced apical targeting of alpha-EC_D012964C subunits. In contrast, the protein abundances of C_D012964(+)/C_D006859(+) exchanger type 3 (NC_D006859E3), C_D012964(+)-C_D011188(+)-2C_D002713(-) cotransporter (BSC-1), and C_D049971-sensitive C_D012964(+)-C_D002713(-) cotransporter (TSC) were decreased. Moreover, the abundance of the alpha(1)-subunit of the C_D012964-C_D011188-ATPase was decreased in the cortex and ISOM, but it remained unchanged in the IM. In conclusion, the increased or sustained expression of EC_D012964C subunits combined with increased apical targeting in the DCT2, connecting tubule, and collecting duct are likely to play a role in the C_D012964 retention associated with C_D011692-induced D_D009404. The decreased abundance of NC_D006859E3, BSC-1, TSC, and C_D012964-C_D011188-ATPase may play a compensatory role to promote C_D012964 excretion.

title:Does hormone therapy for the treatment of D_D001943 have a detrimental effect on memory and cognition? A pilot study.
abstract:This pilot study examines whether hormone therapy for D_D001943 affects cognition. Patients participating in a randomised trial of C_C090450, C_D013629 alone or combined (ATAC) (n=94) and a group of women without D_D001943 (n=35) completed a battery of neuropsychological measures. Compared with the control group, the patients were impaired on a processing speed task (p=0.032) and on a measure of immediate verbal memory (p=0.026) after controlling for the use of hormone replacement therapy in both groups. Patient group performance was not significantly related to length of treatment or measures of psychological morbidity. The results showed specific impairments in processing speed and verbal memory in women receiving hormonal therapy for the treatment of D_D001943. Verbal memory may be especially sensitive to changes in C_D004967 levels, a finding commonly reported in studies of hormone replacement therapy in healthy women. In view of the increased use of hormone therapies in an adjuvant and preventative setting their impact on cognitive functioning should be investigated more thoroughly.

title:Association of C_D009569 production and apoptosis in a model of experimental D_D007674.
abstract:BACKGROUND: In recent studies increased amounts of C_D009569 (C_D009569) and apoptosis have been implicated in various pathological conditions in the kidney. We have studied the role of C_D009569 and its association with apoptosis in an experimental model of D_D009404 induced by a single injection of C_D004317 (C_D004317). METHODS: The alteration in the C_D009569 pathway was assessed by measuring C_D009573 levels in serum/urine and by evaluating the changes in vascular reactivity of the isolated perfused rat kidney (IPRK) system. Rats were stratified into control groups and C_D004317-induced D_D007674 groups. These two groups were then divided into: group 1, animals receiving saline; and group 2, animals receiving C_C004479 (C_C004479) which is a specific inhibitor of inducible-C_D009569 synthase. On day 21, rats were sacrificed after obtaining material for biochemical analysis. RESULTS: Histopathological examination of the kidneys of rats treated with C_D004317 revealed focal areas of D_C537346 and mild D_D009395. They also had significantly higher levels of D_D011507 compared with control and treatment groups (P < 0.05). Urine C_D009573 levels were significantly increased in the C_D004317-D_D007674 group (P < 0.05). In the IPRK C_D010656 and C_D000109 related responses were significantly impaired in the C_D004317-D_D007674 group. Apoptosis was not detected in controls. However, in the C_D004317-D_D007674 group, numerous apoptotic cells were identified in the tubulointerstitial areas. Double staining revealed numerous interstitial apoptotic cells to stain for ED1, a marker for monocytes/macrophages. Treatment with C_C004479 prevented the impairment of renal vascular bed responses and reduced both urine C_D009573 levels and apoptosis to control levels. CONCLUSION: We suggest that interactions between C_D009569 and apoptosis are important in the pathogenesis of the C_D004317-induced D_D009401.

title:The attenuating effect of C_D002354, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, on neuroleptic-induced D_D002375 in rats.
abstract:It is known that beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are effective in the treatment of D_D017109, one of the extrapyramidal side effects that occur during neuroleptic treatment. Neuroleptic-induced D_D002375, a model of neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal side effects, was considered suitable as a model for predicting neuroleptic-induced D_D017109 in humans, although neuroleptic-induced D_D002375 was not considered a specific test for neuroleptic-induced D_D017109. Therefore, the effects of C_D002354, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, on C_D006220-induced D_D002375 in rats were behaviorally studied and compared with those of C_D011433 and C_D001712, a muscarinic receptor antagonist. C_D002354, as well as C_D011433 and C_D001712, inhibited the C_D006220-induced D_D002375. The inhibitory effect of C_D002354 was almost comparable to that of C_D011433, but was weaker than that of C_D001712. C_D002354 did not evoke postsynaptic C_D004298 receptor-stimulating behavioral signs such as stereotypy and D_D009069 in rats. C_D002354 did not antagonize the inhibitory effects of C_D006220 on C_D001058-induced stereotypy and locomotor activity in rats. In addition, C_D002354 did not evoke 5-HT1A receptor-stimulating behavioral signs such as flat body posture and forepaw treading and did not inhibit C_D006916-induced head twitch in rats. Finally, C_D002354 did not inhibit C_D010830-induced lethality in rats. These results strongly suggest that C_D002354 improves C_D006220-induced D_D002375 via its beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic activity and is expected to be effective in the treatment of D_D017109 without attenuating neuroleptic-induced antipsychotic effects due to its postsynaptic C_D004298 receptor antagonistic activity.

title:C_D010396-induced rapidly progressive D_D005921 in a patient with D_D001172.
abstract:A 67-year-old woman with D_D001172 presented rapidly progressive D_D005921 (D_D005921) after 5 months of C_D010396 (250 mg/day) treatment. Light microscopy study showed severe D_D005921 with crescent formation in 60% of the glomeruli and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the wall of an arteriole. Immunofluorescence revealed scanty granular IgG, IgA and C3 deposits along the capillary walls and mesangium. The patient was treated with C_D013256 pulse, plasmapheresis, C_D003520 and C_D010975. A complete recovery of renal function was achieved in a few weeks. This new case of D_D005921 in the course of C_D010396 treatment emphasizes the need for frequent monitoring of renal function and evaluation of urinary sediment and D_D011507 in these patients. The prompt discontinuation of C_D010396 and vigorous treatment measures could allow for a good prognosis as in this case.

title:Nature, time course and dose dependence of C_D015215-related side effects: results from the Multicenter Canadian C_D015215 Trial.
abstract:To characterize the nature, time course and dose dependency of C_D015215-related side effects, we undertook a multicenter, prospective, dose-range finding study. Our study group consisted of 74 HIV-positive homosexual men belonging to groups II B, III and IV C2 from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) classification of D_D015658. Following a 3-week observation period, volunteers were treated with C_D015215 600 mg/day for 18 weeks, 900 mg/day for 9 weeks and 1200 mg/day for 9 weeks, followed by a washout period of 6 weeks after which they were re-started on 1200 mg/day or the highest tolerated dose at 8-hourly intervals. Subjects were randomly assigned to 4-hourly or 8-hourly regimens within CDC groups while taking 600 and 1200 mg/day. Clinical and laboratory evaluations were performed at 3-week intervals. Symptomatic adverse effects were present in 96% of subjects, most commonly D_D009325 (64%), D_D005221 (55%) and D_D006261 (49%). These were generally self-limited, reappearing briefly at each dose increment. A decrease in hemoglobin occurred shortly after initiation of therapy. This was not dose dependent and reversed rapidly upon discontinuation of treatment. A red blood cell count decrease, a mean cell volume increase and a granulocyte count decrease developed early in a dose-independent fashion, reverting at least partially during the washout phase. The decrease in reticulocyte count was dose related between 600 and 900 mg/day with no further change when the dose was escalated to 1200 mg/day. Bone marrow changes occurred rapidly as demonstrated by D_-1 in 95% of 65 specimens at week 18.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

title:Progestational agents and D_D001778. VII. D_D013923 and other complications of C_D003276 therapy in relationship to pretreatment levels of D_D001778 factors: summary report of a ten-year study.
abstract:During a ten-year period, 348 women were studied for a total of 5,877 patient months in four separate studies relating C_D003276s to changes in hematologic parameters. Significant increases in certain factors of the D_D001778 and fibrinolysin systems (factors I,II,VII,VIII,IX, and X and plasminogen) were observed in the treated groups. Severe complications developed in four patients. All four had an abnormal D_D001778 profile, suggesting "D_D019851" before initiation of therapy. Some of these findings represented the most extreme abnormalities seen in the entire group of patients; some increased further during therapy. One of these patients developed a D_D009203 before receiving any medication, shortly after the base-line values were obtained. One patient developed D_D012164 19 months after she began therapy, and another developed D_D013924 after 27 months of therapy. The fourth patient developed D_D013924 14 days after initiation of contraceptive therapy. All four patients were of the A or AB blood group. Previous studies suggested the possiblility of increased propensity for D_D013923 in patients possessing the A antigen. It appears from these data that hematologic work-ups may be useful in women who are about to start long-term C_D003276 therapy.

title:D_D006323 in a child with D_D002547 undergoing C_C009250 induction of anesthesia after preoperative C_D003000.
abstract:C_D003000 is a frequently administered alpha2-adrenergic agonist which can decrease heart rate and blood pressure. We present a case of a 5-year-old child with D_D002547 and D_D004827, receiving C_D003000 for D_D011595, who presented for placement of a C_D001418 pump. Without the knowledge of the medical personnel, the patient's mother administered three doses of C_D003000 during the evening before and morning of surgery to reduce D_D001008. During induction of anesthesia, the patient developed D_D001919 and D_D007022 requiring cardiac resuscitation. There are no previous reports of C_D003000-associated D_D006323 in a child undergoing induction of anesthesia.

title:Effects of C_C519696 and (+/-)-C_C107044, putative sigma2-preferring antagonists, on behavioral toxic and stimulant effects of C_D003042 in mice.
abstract:Earlier studies have demonstrated that antagonism of sigma1 receptors attenuates the D_D012640, lethal, locomotor stimulatory and rewarding actions of C_D003042 in mice. In contrast, the contribution of sigma2 receptors is unclear because experimental tools to selectively target this subtype are unavailable. To begin addressing this need, we characterized C_C519696 (C_C519696) and (+/-)-C_C107044 (C_C107044) in receptor binding and behavioral studies. Receptor binding studies confirmed that C_C519696 and (+/-)-C_C107044 display preferential affinity for sigma2 over sigma1 receptors. In behavioral studies, pretreatment of Swiss Webster mice with C_C519696 or (+/-)-C_C107044 significantly attenuated C_D003042-induced D_D012640 and locomotor activity, but not lethality. When administered alone, (+/-)-C_C107044 produced no significant effects compared to control injections of saline, but C_C519696 had locomotor depressant actions. Together, the data suggest that sigma2 receptor antagonists have the potential to attenuate some of the behavioral effects of C_D003042, and further development of more selective, high affinity ligands are warranted.

title:C_D008713-induced D_D041781.
abstract:C_D008713 is a widely used and generally well-tolerated antithyroid agent. A 43-year-old woman had severe D_D007565 and D_D011537 1 month after receiving C_D008713 (10 mg tid) and C_D011433 (20 mg tid) for treatment of D_D006980. The patient continued treatment for another 4 days after the appearance of D_D007565 until she finished both medications. When seen at the emergency department 2 weeks later, she still had severe D_D007565, D_D011537, and D_D006932, formed mainly of the conjugated fraction. C_D008713-induced D_D002779 was diagnosed, and C_D011433 therapy was resumed. Over the following 9 days, the symptoms improved and plasma C_D001663 levels were normal after 12 weeks without C_D008713. In rare cases within the first few weeks of therapy, this drug can cause severe and reversible D_D041781. Physicians and patients should be aware of this adverse effect so that, upon occurrence, they can discontinue C_D008713 therapy and avoid unnecessary invasive procedures.

In this report, we describe a case of C_D002939-induced D_D009395 and D_D000744. D_D000743 improved after stopping the drug and initiation of C_D013256 therapy. Unfortunately, acute D_D009395 was irreversible and the patient developed D_D007676.

title:Contribution of C_D014635 to the D_D007177.
abstract:We report the case of a 62-year-old man who was administered C_D014635 (C_D014635) and who subsequently developed the D_D007177 (D_D007177). He had been taking C_D014635 for treatment of idiopathic generalized D_D004830 since he was 56 years old. After substituting C_D014635 with C_C022189, the serum C_D012964 level returned to normal. We consider this episode of D_D007177 to be the result of a combination of factors including a D_D002493 and the long-term administration of C_D014635.

In patients with decompensated D_D006333 with D_D007022 after treatment with C_D020105, low doses of C_D014667 restored blood pressure without inhibiting the inotropic effect of C_D020105.

title:Halogenated anesthetics form liver adducts and antigens that cross-react with C_D006221-induced antibodies.
abstract:Two halogenated anesthetics, C_D004737 and C_D007530, have been associated with an allergic-type D_D056486 both alone and following previous exposure to C_D006221. C_D006221 D_D056486 appears to involve an aberrant immune response. An antibody response to a protein-bound biotransformation product (C_D014269 adduct) has been detected on C_D006221 D_D056486 patients. This study was performed to determine cross-reactivity between C_D004737 and C_D007530 with the D_D004342 induced by C_D006221. The subcellular and lobular production of hepatic neoantigens recognized by C_D006221-induced antibodies following C_D004737 and C_D007530, and the biochemical nature of these neoantigens was investigated in two animal models. C_D004737 administration resulted in neoantigens detected in both the microsomal and cytosolic fraction of liver homogenates and in the centrilobular region of the liver. In the same liver, biochemical analysis detected fluorinated liver adducts that were up to 20-fold greater in guinea pigs than in rats. This supports and extends previous evidence for a mechanism by which C_D004737 and/or C_D007530 could produce a D_D004342 condition similar to that of C_D006221 D_D056486 either alone or subsequent to C_D006221 administration. The guinea pig would appear to be a useful model for further investigations of the immunological response to these antigens.

title:Induction by C_D000082 of bladder and liver D_D009369 in the rat. Effects on hepatocyte fine structure.
abstract:Groups of male and female inbred Leeds strain rats were fed diets containing either 0.5% or 1.0% C_D000082 by weight for up to 18 months. At the 1.0% dosage level, 20% of rats of both sexes developed neoplastic nodules of the liver, a statistically significant incidence. These rats also showed gross enlargement of their livers and an increase in foci of cellular alteration, the latter also being observed in the low dosage male rats. D_D010212 of the transitional epithelium of the bladder developed in all C_D000082-treated groups, and three rats bore D_D001749. However, significant yields of D_D001749 were only obtained from low dosage females and high dosage males. Additionally, 20 to 25% of C_D000082-treated rats developed D_D006965 of the bladder epithelium, which was not coincident with the presence of D_D001744. A low yield of D_D009369 at various other sites also arose following C_D000082 feeding. An electron microscope study of the livers of C_D000082-treated rats revealed ultrastructural changes in the hepatocytes that resemble those that result from exposure to a variety of known D_D008113.

title:Rat extraocular muscle regeneration. Repair of local anesthetic-induced damage.
abstract:Local anesthetics that are commonly used in ophthalmic surgery (0.75% C_D002045, 2.0% C_D008619, and 2.0% C_D008012 plus 1:100,000 C_D004837) were injected into the retrobulbar area of rat eyes. Controls were injected with physiological saline. All three anesthetics produced massive degeneration of the extraocular muscles. D_D009135 is followed by regeneration of the damaged muscle fibers. In addition to D_D009135, severe damage was also seen in harderian glands, especially after exposure to C_D008619 and C_D008012 plus C_D004837. With these findings in rats, it is hypothesized that the temporary D_D004172 sometimes seen in patients after ophthalmic surgery might be due to anesthetic-induced damage to the extraocular muscles.

title:Reversal of neuroleptic-induced D_D002375 by novel C_-1 anxiolytic drugs.
abstract:The novel anxiolytic drug, C_D002065, reverses D_D002375 induced by C_D006220. A series of C_-1 analogues of C_D002065 and other C_D058825 were tested for their ability to reverse C_D006220 induced D_D002375. Those drugs with strong affinity for C_D0127011a receptors were able to reverse D_D002375. Drugs with affinity for other C_D012701 receptors or weak affinity were ineffective. However, inhibition of postsynaptic C_D012701 receptors neither inhibited nor potentiated reversal of D_D002375 and leaves open the question as to the site or mechanism for this effect.

title:C_D003975 facilitates reflex D_D001919 in conscious rats.
abstract:The effects of C_D003975 on cardiovascular function were assessed in conscious rats. Intravenous administration of C_D003975 (1-30 mg kg-1) produced a dose-dependent decrease in both the mean arterial pressure and the heart rate. Also, reflex D_D001919 was produced in rats by intravenous infusion of C_D004837 (1.25-2.5 micrograms kg-1). Intravenous pretreatment of the rats with C_D003975, although causing no change in the C_D004837-induced pressor effect, did enhance the C_D004837-induced reflex D_D001919. However, the C_D003975 enhancement of C_D004837-induced reflex D_D001919 was antagonized by pretreatment of rats with an intravenous dose of C_D010852 (an agent blocks C_D002712 channels by binding to sites associated with the C_D001569-C_D005680-C_D002712 channel macromolecular complex). The data indicate that C_D003975 acts through the C_D001569-C_D005680-C_D002712 channel macromolecular complex within the central nervous system to facilitate reflex D_D001919 mediated through baroreceptor reflexes in response to an acute increase in arterial pressure.

title:Chronic C_D002220 inhibits the development of local anesthetic D_D012640 kindled by C_D003042 and C_D008012.
abstract:The effects of C_D002220 (C_D002220) treatment on local anesthetic-kindled D_D012640 and lethality were evaluated in different stages of the kindling process and under different methods of C_D002220 administration. Chronic oral C_D002220 inhibited the development of both C_D008012- and C_D003042-induced D_D012640, but had little effect on the fully developed local anesthetic D_D012640. Chronic C_D002220 also decreased the incidence of D_D012640-related mortality in the C_D003042-injected rats. Acute C_D002220 over a range of doses (15-50 mg/kg) had no effect on completed C_D008012-kindled or acute C_D003042-induced D_D012640. Repeated i.p. injection of C_D002220 (15 mg/kg) also was without effect on the development of C_D008012- or C_D003042-kindled D_D012640. The differential effects of C_D002220 depending upon stage of D_D012640 development suggest that distinct mechanisms underlie the development versus maintenance of local anesthetic-kindled D_D012640. The effectiveness of chronic but not repeated, intermittent injections of C_D002220 suggests that different biochemical consequences result from the different treatment regimens. The possible utility of chronic C_D002220 in preventing the development of toxic side effects in human C_D003042 users is suggested by these data, but remains to be directly evaluated.

title:C_D010396 in the treatment of D_D012594.
abstract:D_D012594 has no recognized internal organ involvement but may be disfiguring and disabling when the cutaneous lesions are extensive or affect children. There is no accepted or proven treatment for D_D012594. Case reports of 11 patients with severe, extensive D_D012594 who were treated with C_D010396 are summarized in this article. This drug was judged to have a favorable effect on the disease course in 7 (64%) of 11 patients. Improvement began within 3 to 6 months and consisted of cessation of active cutaneous lesions in all 7 patients, skin softening in 5, and more normal growth of the affected limb in 2 of 3 children. Joint stiffness and D_D003286 also improved. The dose of C_D010396 associated with a favorable response was as low as 2 to 5 mg/kg per day given over a period ranging from 15 to 53 months. C_D010396 caused D_D009404 in 1 patient and milder reversible D_D011507 in 3 other patients; none developed D_D051437. These data suggest that C_D010396 may be effective in severe cases of D_D012594.

title:Preservation of renal blood flow during D_D007022 induced with C_D018818 in dogs.
abstract:The introduction of drugs that could induce D_D007022 with different pharmacological actions would be advantageous because side effects unique to a specific drug could be minimized by selecting appropriate therapy. Specific C_D004298-1, (C_D0042981) and C_D004298-2 (C_D0042982) receptor agonists are now under clinical investigation. C_D018818 is a specific C_D0042981 receptor agonist that lowers blood pressure by vasodilatation. The hypothesis that C_D018818 could be used to induce D_D007022 and preserve blood flow to the kidney was tested. Systemic aortic blood pressure and renal blood flow were measured continuously with a carotid arterial catheter and an electromagnetic flow probe respectively, in order to compare the cardiovascular and renal vascular effects of C_D018818 and C_D012964 C_D009599 in ten dogs under C_D006221 general anaesthesia. Mean arterial pressure was decreased 30 +/- 8 per cent from control with infusion of C_D018818 (3.4 +/- 2.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) and 34 +/- 4 per cent with infusion of C_D012964 C_D009599 (5.9 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) (NS). Renal blood flow (RBF) increased during C_D018818-induced D_D007022 11 +/- 7 per cent and decreased 21 +/- 8 per cent during C_D012964 C_D009599-induced D_D007022 (P less than 0.01). Sodium C_D009599 is a non-selective arteriolar and venous vasodilator that can produce redistribution of blood flow away from the kidney during induced D_D007022. Fenoldopam is a selective C_D004298-1 (C_D0042981) receptor agonist that causes vasodilatation to the kidney and other organs with C_D0042981 receptors and preserves blood flow to the kidney during induced D_D007022.

title:Antiarrhythmic effects of optical isomers of C_C032151 on canine D_D001145.
abstract:Antiarrhythmic effects of (+)-C_C032151 and (-)-C_C032151 were examined using two canine D_D001145 models. C_D004070 D_D001145, which is suppressed by C_D012964 channel blockers, was induced by intermittent intravenous (i.v.) injection of C_D010042 in C_D010424-anesthetized dogs. Adrenaline D_D001145, which is suppressed by C_D002118 channel blockers, was induced by C_D004837 infusion in C_D006221-anesthetized dogs. Ten and 5 mg/kg i.v. (+)-C_C032151 suppressed C_D004070- and C_D004837-induced D_D001145s, respectively. The minimum effective plasma concentrations of (+)-C_C032151 for C_D004070- and C_D004837-induced D_D001145s were 1.4 +/- 0.4 and 2.0 +/- 0.6 micrograms/ml, respectively (mean +/- SD, n = 6). A lower dose of 1 mg/kg i.v. of (-)-C_C032151 suppressed the C_D004070-induced D_D001145, whereas 5 mg/kg i.v. was needed to suppress C_D004837-induced D_D001145s. The minimum effective plasma concentrations of (-)-C_C032151 for C_D004070- and C_D004837-induced D_D001145 were 0.06 +/- 0.04 and 0.7 +/- 0.1 micrograms/ml, respectively (mean +/- SD, n = 6). The stronger antiarrhythmic effect of (-)-C_C032151 indicates that (-)-isomer may have an effect nearly 5-20 times stronger in suppressing C_D012964 channels, but effects of both drugs on C_D002118 channels may be almost equipotent.

title:Effect of C_D010936 on C_D012110-induced neurobehavioral and biochemical alterations in rats.
abstract:Effect of methanolic extract of C_D010936 (100-300 mg/kg) was studied on C_D012110-induced orofacial D_D004409 and neurochemical alterations. The rats were treated with intraperitoneal C_D012110 (1 mg/kg, ip) for 3 days every other day. On day 5, vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusions were counted for 5 min. C_D012110 treated rats significantly developed vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusions however, coadministration of C_D010936 roots extract (100, 200 and 300 mg/kg, per orally) attenuated the effects. Biochemical analysis of brain revealed that the C_D012110 treatment significantly increased lipid peroxidation and decreased levels of C_D013481 dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and C_D005978 reductase (GSH), an index of oxidative stress process. Coadministration of extract significantly reduced the lipid peroxidation and reversed the decrease in brain SOD, CAT and GSH levels. The results of the present study suggested that C_D010936 had a protective role against C_D012110-induced orofacial D_D004409 and oxidative stress.

title:Comparison of aqueous and gellan ophthalmic C_D013999 with placebo on the 24-hour heart rate response in patients on treatment for D_D005901.
abstract:PURPOSE: Topical beta-blocker treatment is routine therapy in the management of patients with D_D005901. Therapy results in systemic absorption, however, the degree of reduction of resting and peak heart rate has not been quantified. DESIGN: This trial evaluated the effect of placebo, 0.5% aqueous C_D013999 (C_D013999 solution) and a 0.5% C_D013999 suspension that forms a gel on application to the conjunctiva (C_D013999 gellan) on the 24-hour heart rate in patients currently being treated for D_D005901 to quantify the reduction in mean heart rate. METHODS: Forty-three Caucasian patients with primary open-angle D_D005901 or D_D009798 with a mean (+/-SD) age of 63 (+/-8) years were randomized and crossed over in a double-masked manner to 14 days of treatment with placebo (morning and evening in both eyes), C_D013999 solution (morning and evening in both eyes), or C_D013999 gellan (morning in both eyes with placebo in the evening). On the 13th day of each period, heart rate was recorded continuously during a typical, ambulant 24-hour period. RESULTS: Both C_D013999 solution and C_D013999 gellan reduced the mean 24-hour heart rate compared with placebo (P < or = .001), and this reduction was most pronounced during the daytime (-7.5% change in mean heart rate, -5.7 beats/min). C_D013999 gellan showed a numerically but not significantly smaller reduction in 24-hour heart rate, compared with C_D013999 solution. During the night, the mean 12-hour heart rate on placebo and C_D013999 gellan were both significantly less than on C_D013999 solution; the difference between solution and gellan treatments was statistically significant (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Both C_D013999 solution and C_D013999 gellan decrease the mean 24-hour heart rate compared with placebo. This response was most pronounced during the active daytime period. These data quantify the modest D_D001919 associated with ophthalmic beta-blocker therapy in a typical patient population on therapy for D_D005901. Although exercise performance was not assessed in this trial, reductions of this magnitude should not have substantial clinical consequences.

title:C_D005472-induced D_D054549: a case report.
abstract:The D_D054549 (D_D054549) is a recently described stress-mediated D_D006331 characterized by transient wall-motion abnormalities involving the apex and midventricle with D_D006948 of the basal left ventricular (LV) segments without obstructive D_D003327. D_D066126 is not an uncommon adverse effect of chemotherapeutic agents. However, there are no reports of D_D054549 secondary to chemotherapeutic agents. We describe the case of a woman who developed the syndrome after chemotherapy for metastatic D_D009369. A 79-year-old woman presented with typical D_D007511 D_D002637, elevated cardiac enzymes with significant ST-segment abnormalities on her electrocardiogram. She underwent recent chemotherapy with C_D005472 for metastatic colorectal D_D009369. Echocardiography revealed a wall-motion abnormality involving the apical and periapical segments which appeared D_D018476. Coronary angiography revealed no obstructive coronary lesions. The patient was stabilized with medical therapy. Four weeks later she remained completely asymptomatic. Echocardiogram revealed a normal ejection fraction and a resolution of the apical D_D018476. Pathogenetic mechanisms of D_D005117 in D_D009369 patients undergoing chemotherapy include D_D003329, endothelial damage and consequent D_D013927 formation. In our patient, both supraphysiologic levels of plasma C_D002395 and stress related neuropeptides caused by D_D009369 diagnosis as well as chemotherapy may have contributed the development of D_D054549.

title:Reduction of D_D010146 during induction with target-controlled C_D015742 and C_C071741.
abstract:BACKGROUND: D_D010146 on injection of C_D015742 is unpleasant. We hypothesized that C_D015742 infusion D_D010146 might be prevented by infusing C_C071741 before starting the C_D015742 infusion in a clinical setting where target-controlled infusions (TCI) of both drugs were used. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed to determine the effect-site concentration (Ce) of C_C071741 to prevent the D_D010146 without producing complications. METHODS: A total of 128 patients undergoing general surgery were randomly allocated to receive normal saline (control) or C_C071741 to a target Ce of 2 ng ml(-1) (R2), 4 ng ml(-1) (R4), or 6 ng ml(-1) (R6) administered via TCI. After the target Ce was achieved, the infusion of C_D015742 was started. C_C071741-related complications were assessed during the C_C071741 infusion, and D_D010146 caused by C_D015742 was evaluated using a four-point scale during the C_D015742 infusion. RESULTS: The incidence of D_D010146 was significantly lower in Groups R4 and R6 than in the control and R2 groups (12/32 and 6/31 vs 26/31 and 25/32, respectively, P<0.001). D_D010146 was less severe in Groups R4 and R6 than in the control and R2 groups (P<0.001). However, both incidence and severity of D_D010146 were not different between Groups R4 and R6. No significant complications were observed during the study. CONCLUSIONS: During induction of anaesthesia with TCI of C_D015742 and C_C071741, a significant reduction in C_D015742 infusion D_D010146 was achieved without significant complications by prior administration of C_C071741 at a target Ce of 4 ng ml(-1).

title:Prenatal exposure to C_D005473 induces fetal D_D006976 in the rat.
abstract:RATIONALE: C_D005473 is a selective C_D012701 reuptake inhibitor antidepressant widely used by pregnant women. Epidemiological data suggest that C_D005473 exposure prenatally increases the prevalence of persistent D_D006976 of the newborn. The mechanism responsible for this effect is unclear and paradoxical, considering the current evidence of a D_D006976 protective C_D005473 effect in adult rodents. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the C_D005473 effect on fetal rat pulmonary vascular smooth muscle mechanical properties and cell proliferation rate. METHODS: Pregnant rats were treated with C_D005473 (10 mg/kg) from Day 11 through Day 21 of gestation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fetuses were delivered by cesarean section. As compared with controls, C_D005473 exposure resulted in fetal D_D006976 as evidenced by an increase in the weight ratio of the right ventricle to the left ventricle plus septum (P = 0.02) and by an increase in pulmonary arterial medial thickness (P < 0.01). Postnatal mortality was increased among experimental animals, and arterial C_D010100 saturation was 96 +/- 1% in 1-day-old control animals and significantly lower (P < 0.01) in C_D005473-exposed pups (79 +/- 2%). In vitro, C_D005473 induced pulmonary arterial muscle contraction in fetal, but not adult, animals (P < 0.01) and reduced C_D012701-induced contraction at both ages (P < 0.01). After in utero exposure to a low C_D005473 concentration the pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation rate was significantly increased in fetal, but not adult, cells (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the adult, C_D005473 exposure in utero induces D_D006976 in the fetal rat as a result of a developmentally regulated increase in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle proliferation.

title:D_D013575 and D_D008133 among patients treated with C_D008691 for C_D003932 dependence in the city of Copenhagen.
abstract:BACKGROUND: C_D008691 is prescribed to C_D003932 addicts to decrease illicit opioid use. Prolongation of the QT interval in the ECG of patients with D_D016171 (D_D016171) has been reported in C_D008691 users. As C_D003932 addicts sometimes faint while using illicit drugs, doctors might attribute too many episodes of D_D013575 to illicit drug use and thereby underestimate the incidence of D_D016171 in this special population, and the high mortality in this population may, in part, be caused by the proarrhythmic effect of C_D008691. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study interview, ECGs and blood samples were collected in a population of adult C_D003932 addicts treated with C_D008691 or C_D002047 on a daily basis. Of the patients at the Drug Addiction Service in the municipal of Copenhagen, 450 (approximately 52%) were included. The QT interval was estimated from 12 lead ECGs. All participants were interviewed about any experience of D_D013575. The association between opioid dose and QT, and C_D008691 dose and reporting of D_D013575 was assessed using multivariate linear regression and logistic regression, respectively. RESULTS: C_D008691 dose was associated with longer QT interval of 0.140 ms/mg (p = 0.002). No association between C_D002047 and QTc was found. Among the subjects treated with C_D008691, 28% men and 32% women had D_D008133. None of the subjects treated with C_D002047 had QTc interval >0.440 s((1/2)). A 50 mg higher C_D008691 dose was associated with a 1.2 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.4) times higher odds for D_D013575. CONCLUSIONS: C_D008691 is associated with D_D008133 and higher reporting of D_D013575 in a population of C_D003932 addicts.

title:D_D010523 caused by high-dose C_D003561 treatment in a patient with D_D015470.
abstract:The central nervous system D_D064420 of high-dose C_D003561 is well recognized, but the D_D064420 of C_D003561 in the peripheral nervous system has been infrequently reported. A 49-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed with D_D015470. After he achieved complete remission, he received high-dose C_D003561 treatment (2 g/m2 twice a day for 5 days; total, 20 g/m2) as consolidation therapy. The first course of high-dose C_D003561 resulted in no unusual symptoms, but on day 21 of the second course of treatment, the patient complained of D_D006987 in his right foot. Electromyogram and nerve-conduction studies showed D_D010523 in both peroneal nerves. This D_D009422 was gradually resolving; however, after the patient received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, the symptoms worsened, with the development of D_D006086, and the symptoms subsequently responded to C_D008775. Although the mechanisms of D_D010523 are still unclear, high-dose C_D003561 is a therapy that is potentially toxic to the peripheral nervous system, and auto/alloimmunity may play an important role in these mechanisms.

title:C_C065179 prevented and reversed C_D003907-induced D_D006973 in the rat.
abstract:To assess the antioxidant effects of C_C065179 (C_C065179) on C_D003907 (C_D003907)-induced D_D006973, 60 male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with C_C065179 30 mg/kg/day or tap water for 15 days. C_D003907 increased systolic blood pressure (SBP) from 109 +/- 1.8 to 135 +/- 0.6 mmHg and plasma C_D013481 (5711 +/- 284.9 saline, 7931 +/- 392.8 U/ml C_D003907, P < 0.001). In this prevention study, SBP in the C_C065179 + C_D003907 group was increased from 115 +/- 0.4 to 124 +/- 1.5 mmHg, but this was significantly lower than in the C_D003907-only group (P' < 0.05). C_C065179 reversed C_D003907-induced D_D006973 (129 +/- 0.6 mmHg, vs. 135 +/- 0.6 mmHg P' < 0.05) and decreased plasma C_D013481 (7931 +/- 392.8 C_D003907, 1187 +/- 441.2 C_C065179 + C_D003907, P < 0.0001). Plasma C_D009566/C_D009573 (NOx) was decreased in C_D003907-treated rats compared to saline-treated rats (11.2 +/- 1.08 microm, 15.3 +/- 1.17 microm, respectively, P < 0.05). C_C065179 affected neither plasma NOx nor thymus weight. Thus, C_C065179 prevented and reversed C_D003907-induced D_D006973 in the rat.

title:C_D020123 and C_C063008 for calcineurin-free immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients.
abstract:Calcineurin inhibitors, such as C_D016572 and C_D016559, have been available for almost 20 years. Although these drugs are highly effective and represent the mainstay of transplant immunosuppression, they are associated with acute and chronic D_D007674. Acute D_D007674, which occurs in the early period after transplantation, leads to a higher rate of dialysis, and chronic D_D007674 may eventually result in graft loss. Acute and chronic D_D007674 is becoming more common as the use of marginal kidneys for transplantation increases. Two recently available immunosuppressive agents, C_C063008 and C_D020123 (C_D020123), have no D_D007674. The use of these drugs in combination with other agents has led to the development of new paradigms of immunosuppressive therapy. This paper reviews the results of clinical trials that have investigated these new approaches to immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients.

title:Erythropoietin restores the D_D000740-induced reduction in C_D003520 D_D064420 in rat D_D009369.
abstract:The aim of this study was to examine the impact of D_D000740 prevention by recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) treatment on the D_D064420 of C_D003520 in solid experimental D_D009369. D_D000740 was induced using a single dose of C_D016190 (50 mg/kg i.v.) resulting in a long-lasting reduction (30%) of the hemoglobin concentration. In a second group, the development of D_D000740 was prevented by rHuEPO (1000 IU/kg) administered s.c. three times/week starting 7 days before C_D016190 application. Four days after C_D016190 treatment, D_D009369 (DS-D_D012509 of the rat) were implanted s.c. onto the hind food dorsum. Neither C_D016190 nor rHuEPO treatment influenced D_D009369 growth rate per se. When D_D009369 were treated with a single dose of C_D003520 (60 mg/kg i.p.) 5 days after implantation, a growth delay with a subsequent regrowth of the D_D009369 was observed. In the D_D000740 group, the growth delay was significantly shorter compared with nonanemic controls (13.3 days versus 8.6 days). In the group where D_D000740 was prevented by rHuEPO treatment, growth delay was comparable with that of nonanemic controls (13.3 days). These results suggest that chemotherapy-induced D_D000740 reduces D_D064420 of C_D003520 in D_D009369, whereas correction of D_D000740 by rHuEPO treatment (epoetin alpha) increases the sensitivity, probably as a result of an improved C_D010100 supply to D_D009369 tissue.

title:The role of nitrergic system in C_D008012-induced D_D012640 in the mouse.
abstract:The effects of C_D019331 (C_D019331) a C_D009569 (C_D009569) synthase inhibitor and C_D001120, a C_D009569 precursor, were investigated on C_D008012-induced D_D012640s. In the first experiment, four groups of mice received physiological saline (0.9%), C_D001120 (300 mg/kg, i.p.), C_D019331 (100 mg/kg, i.p.) and C_D003975 (2 mg/kg), respectively. Thirty minutes after these injections, all mice received C_D008012 (50 mg/kg, i.p.). In the second experiment, four groups of mice received similar treatment in the first experiment, and 30 min after these injections, all mice received a higher dose of C_D008012 (80 mg/kg). C_D019331 (100 mg/kg, i.p.) and C_D003975 (2 mg/kg) significantly decreased the incidence of C_D008012 (50 mg/kg)-induced D_D012640s. In contrast, the C_D001120 treatment increased the incidence of C_D008012 (80 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced D_D012640s significantly. These results may suggest that C_D009569 is a proconvulsant mediator in C_D008012-induced D_D012640s.

title:Effect of intravenous C_D008790 or intravenous C_D008790 plus glucagon on C_D004280-induced D_D017202.
abstract:STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of C_D008790 on C_D004280 stress testing with C_D017256 single-photon emission computed tomography imaging and ST-segment monitoring, and to assess the impact of intravenous glucagon on C_D008790's effects. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Community hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-two patients with known reversible perfusion defects. INTERVENTION: Patients underwent C_D004280 stress tests per standard protocol. Before C_D004280 was begun, no therapy was given during the first visit, and patients were randomized on subsequent visits to receive C_D008790 or C_D008790 plus glucagon 1 mg. C_D008790 was dosed to achieve a resting preC_D004280 heart rate below 65 beats/minute or a total intravenous dose of 20 mg. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: C_D008790 reduced maximum heart rate 31%, summed stress scores 29%, and summed difference scores 43% versus control. C_D008790 plus glucagon also reduced the maximum heart rate 29% versus control. Summed stress and summed difference scores were not significantly reduced, although they were 18% and 30% lower, respectively, than control. No significant differences were found in any parameter between C_D008790 and C_D008790-glucagon. CONCLUSION: During C_D004280 stress testing, C_D008790 attenuates or eliminates evidence of D_D017202. Glucagon 1 mg, although somewhat effective, does not correct this effect to the extent that it can be administered clinically.

title:C_D011239-induced D_D018908 is caused more by D_D001284 than by altered C_D000109 receptor expression.
abstract:Large doses of glucocorticoids can alter muscle physiology and susceptibility to neuromuscular blocking drugs by mechanisms not clearly understood. We investigated the effects of moderate and large doses of C_D011239 on muscle function and pharmacology, and their relationship to changes in muscle size and C_D000109 receptor (AChR) expression. With institutional approval, 35 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to receive daily subcutaneous doses of 10 mg/kg C_D011239 (P10 group), 100 mg/kg C_D011239 (P100 group), or an equal volume of saline (S group) for 7 days. A fourth group of rats was pair fed (food restricted) with the P100 rats for 7 days (FR group). On Day 8, the nerve-evoked peak twitch tensions, D_D013746 tensions, and fatigability, and the dose-response curves of C_D014403 in the tibialis cranialis muscle were measured in vivo and related to muscle mass or expression of AChRs. Rate of body weight gain was depressed in the P100, FR, and P10 groups compared with the S group. Tibialis muscle mass was smaller in the P100 group than in the P10 or S groups. The evoked peak twitch and D_D013746 tensions were less in the P100 group than in the P10 or S groups, however, tension per milligram of muscle mass was greater in the P100 group than in the S group. The 50% effective dose of C_D014403 (microg/kg) in the tibialis muscle was smaller in the P10 (33.6 +/- 5.4) than in the S (61.9 +/- 5.0) or the P100 (71.3 +/- 9.6) groups. AChR expression was less in the P10 group than in the S group. The evoked tensions correlated with muscle mass (r(2) = 0.32, P < 0.001), however, not with expression of AChR. The 50% effective dose of C_D014403 did not correlate with muscle mass or AChR expression. Our results suggest that the D_D009468 after C_D011239 is dose-dependent, and derives primarily from muscle D_D001284 and derives less so from changes in AChR expression. IMPLICATIONS: The mechanisms by which chronic glucocorticoid therapy alters neuromuscular physiology and pharmacology are unclear. We suggest that the observed effects are dose-dependent and derive primarily from muscle D_D001284 and derive less from changes in C_D000109 receptor expression.

title:Effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on hemostasis in patients with D_D013345.
abstract:Platelet function is impaired by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with prominent anti-inflammatory properties. Their safety in patients undergoing intracranial surgery is under debate. Patients with D_D013345 (D_D013345) were randomized to receive either C_D007660, 100 mg, three times a day (C_D007660 group, n = 9) or a weak NSAID, C_D000082, 1 g, three times a day (C_D000082 group, n = 9) starting immediately after the diagnosis of D_D017542 D_D013345. Treatment was continued for 3 days postoperatively. Test blood samples were taken before treatment and surgery as well as on the first, third, and fifth postoperative mornings. Maximal D_D001791 induced by 6 microM of C_D000244 decreased after administration of C_D007660. Aggregation was lower (P < .05) in the C_D007660 group than in the C_D000082 group just before surgery and on the third postoperative day. In contrast, maximal D_D001791 increased in the C_D000082 group on the third postoperative day as compared with the pretreatment D_D001791 results (P < .05). One patient in the C_D007660 group developed a postoperative intracranial D_D006406. Coagulation (prothrombin time [PT], activated partial thromboplastin time [APPT], fibrinogen concentration, and antithrombin III [AT III]) was comparable between the two groups. C_D007660 but not C_D000082 impaired platelet function in patients with D_D013345. If C_D007660 is used before surgery on cerebral D_D002532, it may pose an additional risk factor for D_D006470.

title:Value of C_D008775 in prevention of the D_D018771-D_D063806 syndrome associated with the total dose infusion of C_D007505: a double blind randomized trial.
abstract:The safety and efficacy of total dose infusion (TDI) of C_D007505 has been well documented. In 40% of treated patients, an D_D018771-D_D063806 syndrome develops. The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, prospective study was to investigate whether intravenous (i.v.) administration of C_D008775 (C_D008775) prevents this complication. Sixty-five patients, 34 women and 31 men, ages 36 to 80 years, received either normal saline before and after TDI (group 1), 125 mg i.v. C_D008775 before and saline after TDI (group 2), or 125 mg i.v. C_D008775 before and after TDI (group 3). Patients were observed for 72 hours and reactions were recorded and graded according to severity. Fifty-eight percent of group 1 patients, 33% of group 2, and 26% of group 3 had reactions to TDI. The severity of reactions (minimal, mild, and moderate, respectively) was as follows: group 1--6, 6, and 2; group 2--1, 5, and 0; group 3--5, 1, and 0. Data were analyzed by the two-sided Fisher's exact test using 95% confidence intervals with the approximation of Woolf. These data demonstrate that administration of C_D008775 before and after TDI reduces the frequency and severity of the D_D018771-D_D063806 syndrome. We conclude that 125 mg i.v. C_D008775 should be given routinely before and after TDI of C_D007505.

title:Long-term effects of C_D014750 on the peripheral nervous system.
abstract:Forty patients with D_D008228 treated with C_D014750 between 1984 and 1990 (cumulative dose 12 mg in 18-24 weeks) were investigated in order to evaluate the long term effects of C_D014750 on the peripheral nervous system. The patients were interviewed with emphasis on D_D012678. Physical and quantitative sensory examination with determination of vibratory perception and thermal discrimination thresholds were performed, four to 77 months (median 34 months) after C_D014750 treatment. Twenty-seven patients reported D_D012678. In 13 of these 27 patients symptoms were still present at the time of examination. In these patients sensory signs and symptoms predominated. In the other 14 patients symptoms had been present in the past. Symptoms persisted maximally 40 months since cessation of therapy. There was no age difference between patients with and without complaints at the time of examination. Normal reflexes were found in two third of patients. Neuropathic complaints were not very troublesome on the long term. It is concluded that with the above mentioned C_D014750 dose schedule signs and symptoms of C_D014750 D_D009422 are reversible for a great deal and prognosis is fairly good.

Patients receiving C_D010396 therapy should be followed carefully for the development of autoimmune complications like D_D017285/D_D003882.

title:Photodistributed C_D009543-induced facial D_D013684.
abstract:Five months after starting C_D009543 (C_D009543), two patients developed photodistributed facial D_D013684, which became more noticeable with time. Neither patient complained of photosensitivity or D_D005483. Both patients reported a significant cosmetic improvement after discontinuing the drug. One commenced the closely related drug C_D017311 3 years later, with recurrence of D_D013684. The photodistribution of the D_D013684 suggests a significant drug/light interaction.

title:D_D007674 of C_D016572 and C_D016559: inhibition of calcineurin phosphatase.
abstract:C_D016572 (C_D016572; 50 mg/kg) and C_D016559 (C_D016559; 5 mg/kg), but not the related C_D018942 immunosuppressant C_D020123 (5 mg/kg), caused a reduction of glomerular filtration rate, degenerative changes of proximal tubular epithelium, and D_D006984 of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in male Wistar rats when given for 10 days. The molecular mechanisms of C_D016572 and C_D016559 D_D064420 were investigated. Cyclophilin A and C_D016559-binding protein, the main intracytoplasmic receptors for C_D016572 and C_D016559, respectively, were each detected in renal tissue extract. In the kidney, high levels of immunoreactive and enzymatically active calcineurin were found which were inhibited by the immunosuppressants C_D016572 and C_D016559, but not by C_D020123. Finally, specific immunophilin-drug-calcineurin complexes formed only in the presence of C_D016572 and C_D016559, but not C_D020123. These results suggest that the D_D007674 effects of C_D016572 and C_D016559 is likely mediated through binding to renal immunophilin and inhibiting calcineurin phosphatase.

abstract:The clinical and autopsy findings in a premature baby who died of D_D058186 after therapy with C_D005839 (5 mg/kg/day) and C_D010406 are presented. The serum C_D005839 concentration had reached toxic levels when D_D001002 developed. Numerous C_D010504 Schiff (PAS) positive, diastase resistant cytoplasmic inclusion bodies which appeared as myelin figures in cytosegresomes under the electron microscope were identified in the proximal convoluted tubules. The pathological changes induced by C_D005839 in the human neonatal kidneys have not been previously reported.

title:Anti-D_D063646 action of C_D010634 given simultaneously with C_D004052 in the rat.
abstract:The present work has been planned in order to elucidate the effect of C_D010634 (C_D010634: 15 mg per rat of ingested dose) on D_D063646 when it is administered simultaneously with C_D004052 (C_D004052: 10 mg/kg/day). Wistar rats (180 g) were treated by C_D004052 alone or by C_D004052 + C_D010634 during 2, 4 and 6 weeks according to our schedule for hepatoD_D063646. After the end of the treatment, the number and the size of induced PAS positive D_D011230 was significantly reduced when C_D010634 was given simultaneously with C_D004052 for 4 and 6 weeks. The mitotic inhibition and the production of micronuclei normally observed after partial hepatectomy in C_D004052 treated rats were also significantly decreased in C_D004052 + C_D010634 treated rats. When the treatment last only 2 weeks, the presence of C_D010634 did not change significantly the last parameters. In C_D004052 + C_D010634 treated rats, the survival was prolonged and the D_D009369 incidence decreased as compared with the results obtained by C_D004052 alone. It is concluded that C_D010634, which promotes D_D063646 when administered after the C_D004052 treatment, reduces the carcinogen effect when given simultaneously with C_D004052. This 'anti-carcinogen' effect acts on the initiation as well as on the promotion of the D_D011230. Biochemical investigations are in progress to obtain more information about this 'paradoxical' C_D010634 effect.

C_D001971 given in high doses has been associated with D_D011605 in patients receiving the drug for D_D010300. These cases demonstrate that C_D001971 may cause D_D011605 even when given in low doses.

title:A prospective study on the dose dependency of D_D066126 induced by C_D016685.
abstract:Since 1975 C_D016685 (C_D016685) has been suggested to be D_D066126, especially when combined with or given following C_D004317. Data on dose dependency or incidence concerning this side effect were not known. We have initiated a prospective study to obtain some more data on these subjects. Forty-four C_D016685-treated patients were studied, 37 of them could be evaluated. All patients were studied by repeated physical examinations, chest X-rays, electro- and echocardiography and radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) determinations. The results were evaluated per cumulative dose level. One of the patients developed D_D006333 after 30 mg m-2 C_D016685 and only 150 mg m-2 C_D004317. The D_D006333 was predicted by a drop in EF determined during a cold pressor test. None of the other patients developed clinical D_D066126, nor did the studied parameters change. The literature on this subject was also reviewed. Based on the combined data from the present study and the literature, we suggest that C_D016685-related D_D066126 is dose dependent, occurring at cumulative dose levels of 30 mg m-2 or more, mainly in patients also (previously or simultaneously) treated with C_D004317. The incidence is likely to be less than 10% even for this risk group.

title:C_D010695-induced D_D006029 does not prevent C_D005839 D_D007674 in rats.
abstract:Because rats with C_D013311-induced D_D003920 (D_D003920) have a high solute diuresis (D_D006029 of 10 to 12 g/day), we have suggested that this may in part be responsible for their resistance to C_D005839-induced D_D058186 (D_D058186). The protection from C_D005839 D_D007674 was studied in non-D_D003920 rats with chronic solute diuresis induced by blockage of tubular C_D005947 reabsorption with C_D010695 (C_D010695). D_D003920 rats with mild D_D006029 (similar in degree to that of the C_D010695 treated animals) were also studied. Unanesthetized adult female, Sprague-Dawley rats were divided in four groups and studied for 15 days. Group 1 (C_D010695 alone) received C_D010695, 360 mg/day, for 15 days; Group II (C_D010695 + C_D005839); Group III (C_D005839 alone) and Group IV (mild D_D003920 + C_D005839). D_D007674 doses (40 mg/kg body wt/day) of C_D005839 were injected during the last nine days of study to the animals of groups II to IV. In Group I, C_D010695 induced a moderate and stable D_D006029 (3.9 +/- 0.1 g/day, SE), and no functional or morphologic evidence of D_D007674 (baseline CCr 2.1 +/- 0.1 ml/min, undetectable lysozymuria) or damage (D_D009956 score [maximum 4], zero). In Group II, C_D010695 did not prevent C_D005839-D_D058186 (maximal decrease in CCr at day 9.89%, C_D010695 less than 0.001; peak lysozymuria, 1863 +/- 321 micrograms/day; and D_D009956 score, 3.9 +/- 0.1). These values were not different from those of Group III: maximal decrease in CCr 73% (C_D010695 less than 0.001); lysozymuria, 2147 +/- 701 micrograms/day; D_D009956 score, 3.8 +/- 0.1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

title:C_D063325 in C_D007980-induced D_D004409.
abstract:C_D063325, a substituted C_C037689 derivative closely related to C_D008787, reduced C_D007980-induced peak dose D_D004409 in 16 patients with D_D010300. However, an unacceptable increase in disability from D_D010300 with aggravation of end-of-dose D_D004409 led to its cessation in 14 patients. C_D063325 had no effect on C_D007980-induced early morning of "off-period" segmental D_D004421. These results fail to support the notion that C_D007980-induced D_D004409 are caused by overstimulation of a separate group of C_D004298 receptors.

title:Effects of the hippocampal deep brain stimulation on cortical D_D004827 discharges in C_D010406 - induced D_D004827 model in rats.
abstract:AIM: Experimental and clinical studies have revealed that hippocampal DBS can control D_D004827 activity, but the mechanism of action is obscure and optimal stimulation parameters are not clearly defined. The aim was to evaluate the effects of high frequency hippocampal stimulation on cortical D_D004827 activity in C_D010406-induced D_D004827 model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-five Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted DBS electrodes. In group-1 (n=10) hippocampal DBS was off and in the group-2 (n=10) hippocampal DBS was on (185 Hz, 0.5V, 1V, 2V, and 5V for 60 sec) following C_D010406 G injection intracortically. In the control group hippocampal DBS was on following 8  l saline injection intracortically. EEG recordings were obtained before and 15 minutes following C_D010406-G injection, and at 10th minutes following each stimulus for analysis in terms of frequency, amplitude, and power spectrum. RESULTS: High frequency hippocampal DBS suppressed the acute C_D010406-induced cortical D_D004827 activity independent from stimulus intensity. In the control group, hippocampal stimulation alone lead only to diffuse slowing of cerebral bioelectrical activity at 5V stimulation. CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that continuous high frequency stimulation of the hippocampus suppressed acute cortical D_D004827 activity effectively without causing secondary D_D004827 discharges. These results are important in terms of defining the optimal parameters of hippocampal DBS in patients with D_D004827.

title:Neural correlates of C_-1 induced D_D011605 during overt continuous verbal fluency.
abstract:The glutamatergic C_D016202 (C_D016202) receptor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of D_D012559. Administered to healthy volunteers, a subanesthetic dose of the non-competitive C_D016202 receptor antagonist C_D007649 leads to psychopathological symptoms similar to those observed in D_D012559. In patients with D_D012559, C_D007649 exacerbates the core symptoms of illness, supporting the hypothesis of a D_D018754. In a counterbalanced, placebo-controlled, double-blind study design, healthy subjects were administered a continuous subanesthetic C_-1 infusion while differences in BOLD responses measured with fMRI were detected. During the scanning period, subjects performed continuous overt verbal fluency tasks (phonological, lexical and semantic). C_D007649-induced psychopathological symptoms were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). C_D007649 elicited D_D011605 like psychopathology. Post-hoc t-tests revealed significant differences between placebo and C_D007649 for the amounts of words generated during lexical and semantic verbal fluency, while the phonological domain remained unaffected. C_D007649 led to enhanced cortical activations in supramarginal and frontal brain regions for phonological and lexical verbal fluency, but not for semantic verbal fluency. C_D007649 induces activation changes in healthy subjects similar to those observed in patients with D_D012559, particularly in frontal and temporal brain regions. Our results provide further support for the hypothesis of an C_D016202 receptor dysfunction in the pathophysiology of D_D012559.

title:C_D004298 is not essential for the development of C_D008694-induced D_D020258.
abstract:It is widely believed that C_D004298 (C_D004298) mediates C_D008694 (C_D008694)-induced D_D064420 to brain C_D004298rgic neurons, because drugs that interfere with C_D004298 neurotransmission decrease D_D064420, whereas drugs that increase C_D004298 neurotransmission enhance D_D064420. However, temperature effects of drugs that have been used to manipulate brain C_D004298 neurotransmission confound interpretation of the data. Here we show that the recently reported ability of C_D007980 to reverse the protective effect of C_D019805 on C_D008694-induced C_D004298 D_D020258 is also confounded by drug effects on body temperature. Further, we show that mice genetically engineered to be deficient in brain C_D004298 develop C_D008694 D_D020258, as long as the thermic effects of C_D008694 are preserved. In addition, we demonstrate that mice genetically engineered to have unilateral brain C_D004298 deficits develop C_D008694-induced C_D004298rgic deficits that are of comparable magnitude on both sides of the brain. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that C_D004298 is not essential for the development of C_D008694-induced C_D004298rgic D_D020258 and suggest that mechanisms independent of C_D004298 warrant more intense investigation.

title:The protective role of Nrf2 in C_D013311-induced D_D003928.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: D_D003928 is one of the major causes of D_D051437, which is accompanied by the production of reactive C_D010100 species (ROS). Nrf2 is the primary transcription factor that controls the antioxidant response essential for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. Here, we report our findings demonstrating a protective role of Nrf2 against D_D003928. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We explore the protective role of Nrf2 against D_D003928 using human kidney biopsy tissues from D_D003928 patients, a C_D013311-induced D_D003928 model in Nrf2(-/-) mice, and cultured human mesangial cells. RESULTS: The glomeruli of human D_D003928 patients were under oxidative stress and had elevated Nrf2 levels. In the animal study, Nrf2 was demonstrated to be crucial in ameliorating C_D013311-induced D_D058186. This is evident by Nrf2(-/-) mice having higher ROS production and suffering from greater oxidative DNA damage and D_D058186 compared with Nrf2(+/+) mice. Mechanistic studies in both in vivo and in vitro systems showed that the Nrf2-mediated protection against D_D003928 is, at least, partially through inhibition of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and reduction of extracellular matrix production. In human renal mesangial cells, high C_D005947 induced ROS production and activated expression of Nrf2 and its downstream genes. Furthermore, activation or overexpression of Nrf2 inhibited the promoter activity of TGF-beta1 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas knockdown of Nrf2 by siRNA enhanced TGF-beta1 transcription and fibronectin production. CONCLUSIONS: This work clearly indicates a protective role of Nrf2 in D_D003928, suggesting that dietary or therapeutic activation of Nrf2 could be used as a strategy to prevent or slow down the progression of D_D003928.

title:High-dose C_D014148 is associated with nonischemic clinical D_D012640 in cardiac surgical patients.
abstract:BACKGROUND: In 2 separate centers, we observed a notable increase in the incidence of postoperative D_D012640 D_D012640 from 1.3% to 3.8% in patients having undergone major cardiac surgical procedures. These events were temporally coincident with the initial use of high-dose C_D014148 (C_D014148) therapy after withdrawal of aprotinin from general clinical usage. The purpose of this review was to perform a retrospective analysis to examine whether there was a relation between C_D014148 usage and D_D012640 after cardiac surgery. METHODS: An in-depth chart review was undertaken in all 24 patients who developed perioperative D_D012640. Electroencephalographic activity was recorded in 11 of these patients, and all patients had a formal neurological evaluation and brain imaging studies. RESULTS: Twenty-one of the 24 patients did not have evidence of new D_D001930, but D_D012640 were likely due to D_D001930 in 3 patients. All patients with D_D012640 did not have permanent D_D009422. All 24 patients with D_D012640 received high doses of C_D014148 intraoperatively ranging from 61 to 259 mg/kg, had a mean age of 69.9 years, and 21 of 24 had undergone open chamber rather than coronary bypass procedures. All but one patient were managed using cardiopulmonary bypass. No evidence of D_D002546, metabolic, or D_D005334-induced causes for their D_D012640 was apparent. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that use of high-dose C_D014148 in older patients in conjunction with cardiopulmonary bypass and open-chamber cardiac surgery is associated with clinical D_D012640 in susceptible patients.

title:Longitudinal assessment of air conduction audiograms in a phase III clinical trial of C_D000518 and C_D013467 for prevention of sporadic D_D015179.
abstract:A phase III clinical trial assessed the recurrence of D_D018256 after treatment for 36 months with C_D000518 (C_D000518) plus C_D013467 or matched placebos. Temporary D_D034381 is a known D_D064420 of treatment with C_D000518, thus a comprehensive approach was developed to analyze serial air conduction audiograms. The generalized estimating equation method estimated the mean difference between treatment arms with regard to change in air conduction pure tone thresholds while accounting for within-subject correlation due to repeated measurements at frequencies. Based on 290 subjects, there was an average difference of 0.50 dB between subjects treated with C_D000518 plus C_D013467 compared with those treated with placebo (95% confidence interval, -0.64 to 1.63 dB; P = 0.39), adjusted for baseline values, age, and frequencies. In the normal speech range of 500 to 3,000 Hz, an estimated difference of 0.99 dB (-0.17 to 2.14 dB; P = 0.09) was detected. Dose intensity did not add information to models. There were 14 of 151 (9.3%) in the C_D000518 plus C_D013467 group and 4 of 139 (2.9%) in the placebo group who experienced at least 15 dB hearing reduction from baseline in 2 or more consecutive frequencies across the entire range tested (P = 0.02). Follow-up air conduction done at least 6 months after end of treatment showed an adjusted mean difference in hearing thresholds of 1.08 dB (-0.81 to 2.96 dB; P = 0.26) between treatment arms. There was no significant difference in the proportion of subjects in the C_D000518 plus C_D013467 group who experienced clinically significant D_D034381 compared with the placebo group. The estimated attributable risk of otoD_D064420 from exposure to the drug is 8.4% (95% confidence interval, -2.0% to 18.8%; P = 0.12). There is a <2 dB difference in mean threshold for patients treated with C_D000518 plus C_D013467 compared with those treated with placebo.

title:Increased D_D003072 associated with the APOE epsilon4 allele after C_D014282 oral anticholinergic challenge in healthy elderly.
abstract:OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to examine the relationship between APOE epsilon4 and subjective effects of C_D014282 on measures reflecting sedation and D_D003221 and to investigate the relationship between C_D014282-induced subjective effects and objective memory performance. METHODS: This study comprised 24 cognitively intact, health elderly adults (12 APOE epsilon4 carriers) at an outpatient geriatric psychiatry research clinic. This was a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, three-way, crossover experimental design. All participants received 1.0 mg or 2.0 mg C_D014282 or placebo administered in counterbalanced sequences over a period of three consecutive weeks. Bond and Lader's visual analog scales and alternate versions of the Buschke Selective Reminding Test were administered in a repeated measures design at baseline, 1, 2.5, and 5 hours postdrug administration. RESULTS: A 2.0-mg oral dose of C_D014282 resulted in increased subjective ratings of D_D003072 in carriers of the APOE epsilon4 allele only. Drug effects as determined by difference scores between 2.0 mg C_D014282 and placebo on ratings of D_D003072 significantly correlated with total and delayed recall on the Buschke Selective Reminding Test in carriers of the APOE epsilon4 allele only. However, no significant effects were found with other visual analog scales reflecting subjective sedation and clear-headedness. CONCLUSION: The epsilon4 allele in healthy elderly was associated with increased subjective D_D003072 after C_D014282 anticholinergic challenge.

C_D012701 was depleted beginning on postnatal day 26 with C_-1 (C_-1 100 mg/kg, every other day); controls received saline. At puberty (P40), half the C_-1-treated rats and half the saline-treated rats began treatment with C_D013739 (C_D013739, 5 mg/kg, 5 days/week). Behavioral measures included locomotion, D_D001523, copulation, partner preference, and D_D001523. Animals were tested for D_D001523 in their home cage, both with and without physical provocation (mild tail pinch). Brain levels of C_D012701 and its metabolite, C_D006897 (C_D006897), were determined using HPLC. C_-1 significantly and substantially depleted C_D012701 and C_D006897 in all brain regions examined. Chronic C_D013739 treatment significantly decreased C_D012701 and C_D006897 in certain brain areas, but to a much lesser extent than C_-1. Chronic exposure to C_-1 alone significantly decreased locomotor activity and increased D_D001523 but had no effect on sexual behavior, partner preference, or D_D001523. C_D013739 alone had no effect on locomotion, D_D001523, or sexual behavior but increased partner preference and D_D001523. C_D013739he most striking effect of combining C_D013739+C_-1 was a significant increase in attack frequency as well as a significant decrease in the latency to attack, particularly following physical provocation. Based on these data, it can be speculated that pubertal AAS users with low central C_D012701 may be especially prone to exhibit D_D001523.

title:Intracavitary chemotherapy (C_D017239/C_D016190 liquid crystalline cubic phases) for recurrent D_D005909 -- clinical observations.
abstract:Human malignant D_D001932 have a poor prognosis in spite of surgery and radiation therapy. Cubic phases consist of curved biocontinuous lipid bilayers, separating two congruent networks of water channels. Used as a host for cytotoxic drugs, the gel-like matrix can easily be applied to the walls of a surgical resection cavity. For human D_D005909 recurrences, the feasibility, safety, and short-term effects of a surgical intracavitary application of C_D017239 and C_D016190 encapsulated by liquid crystalline cubic phases are examined in a pilot study. A total of 12 patients with a recurrence of a D_D005909 multiforme underwent re-resection and received an intracavitary application of C_D017239 and C_D016190 cubic phases in different dosages. Six of the patients received more than 15 mg C_D017239 and suffered from moderate to severe D_D001929, while the remaining patients received only a total of 15 mg C_D017239. In the latter group, D_D001929 was markedly reduced and dealt medically. Intracavitary chemotherapy in recurrent D_D005909 using cubic phases is feasible and safe, yet the clinical benefit remains to be examined in a clinical phase II study.

abstract:An 82-year-old man with D_D061218 and early D_D000544 was started on C_D008774. Significant D_D009771 ensued but diminished over several weeks when C_D008774 was replaced by C_D016666. The patient had no prior D_D001523 history, but he had a sister with D_D009771. It appears that C_D008774 precipitated the patient's pathological behavior.

title:D_D006323 after intravenous C_D008787 - a case of five repeated injections of C_D008787 causing five episodes of D_D006323.
abstract:We describe a patient where intravenous injection of C_D008787 was immediately followed by D_D006323 repeatedly. The patient received C_D008787 10 mg i.v. five times during 48 h. After interviewing the attending nurses and reviewing the written documentation, it is clear that every administration of C_D008787 was immediately (within s) followed by D_D006323. The D_D006323 lasted 15-30 s on four occasions, on one occasion it lasted 2 min. The patient received C_D001285 0.5-1 mg and chest compressions, before sinus rhythm again took over. We interpret this as episodes of D_D006323 caused by C_D008787. The rapid injection via the central venous route and the concomitant tapering of C_D004298 infusion might have contributed in precipitating the adverse drug reaction.

abstract:Second- and third-generation C_D002511, especially C_D015313, are increasingly associated with severe, sometimes fatal immune D_D000743. We noticed that 10 of our 35 cases of C_D015313-induced D_D000743s were in patients who had received C_D015313 prophylactically for obstetric and gynecologic procedures. Eight of these cases of severe immune D_D000743 are described.

title:D_D011128 after spinal anaesthesia with hyperbaric 5% C_D008012: a review of six cases of D_D011128 reported to the Swedish Pharmaceutical Insurance 1993-1997.
abstract:Six cases of D_D011128 with varying severity were reported to the Swedish Pharmaceutical Insurance during the period 1993-1997. All were associated with spinal anaesthesia using hyperbaric 5% C_D008012. Five cases had single-shot spinal anaesthesia and one had a repeat spinal anaesthetic due to inadequate block. The dose of hyperbaric 5% C_D008012 administered ranged from 60 to 120 mg. Three of the cases were most likely caused by direct D_D020258 of hyperbaric 5% C_D008012. In the other 3 cases, direct D_D020258 was also probable, but unfortunately radiological investigations were not done to definitely exclude a compressive aetiology. All cases sustained permanent D_D009461. We recommend that hyperbaric C_D008012 should be administered in concentrations not greater than 2% and at a total dose preferably not exceeding 60 mg.

title:Cortical motor overactivation in D_D020734 patients with C_D007980-induced peak-dose D_D004409.
abstract:We have studied the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes induced by the execution of a finger-to-thumb opposition motor task in the supplementary and primary motor cortex of two groups of D_D020734 patients on C_D007980 medication, the first one without C_D007980 induced D_D004409 (n = 23) and the other with moderate peak-dose D_D004409 (n = 15), and of a group of 14 normal subjects. Single photon emission tomography with i.v. 133Xe was used to measure the rCBF changes. The D_D004409 D_D020734 patients exhibited a pattern of response which was markedly different from those of the normal subjects and non-D_D004409 D_D020734 patients, with a significant overactivation in the supplementary motor area and the ipsi- and contralateral primary motor areas. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that an D_D006948 D_D004409, like C_D007980-induced peak dose D_D004409, is due to a disinhibition of the primary and associated motor cortex secondary to an excessive outflow of the pallidothalamocortical motor loop.

title:C_D003907-induced D_D009798 in perfusion-cultured human eyes.
abstract:PURPOSE: Glucocorticoid administration can lead to the development of D_D009798 and D_D005901 in a subset of the population through a decrease in the aqueous humor outflow facility. The purpose of this study was to determine whether glucocorticoid treatment can directly affect the outflow facility of isolated, perfusion-cultured human eyes. METHODS: The anterior segments of human donor eyes from regional eye banks were placed in a constant flow, variable pressure perfusion culture system. Paired eyes were perfused in serum-free media with or without 10(-7) M C_D003907 for 12 days. Intraocular pressure was monitored daily. After incubation, the eyes were morphologically characterized by light microscopy, transmission and scanning electron microscopy, and scanning laser confocal microscopy. RESULTS: A significant increase in intraocular pressure developed in 13 of the 44 pairs of eyes perfused with C_D003907 with an average pressure rise of 17.5 +/- 3.8 mm Hg after 12 days of C_D003907 exposure. The contralateral control eyes, which did not receive C_D003907, maintained a stable intraocular pressure during the same period. The outflow pathway of the untreated eyes appeared morphologically normal. In contrast, the C_D003907-treated D_D009798 had thickened trabecular beams, decreased intertrabecular spaces, thickened juxtacanalicular tissue, activated trabecular meshwork cells, and increased amounts of amorphogranular extracellular material, especially in the juxtacanalicular tissue and beneath the endothelial lining of the canal of Schlemm. The C_D003907-treated nonresponder eyes appeared to be morphologically similar to the untreated eyes, although several subtle C_D003907-induced morphologic changes were evident. CONCLUSION: C_D003907 treatment of isolated, perfusion-cultured human eyes led to the generation of D_D009798 in approximately 30% of the C_D003907-treated eyes. C_D013256 treatment resulted in morphologic changes in the trabecular meshwork similar to those reported for D_D005901 and D_D005902. This system may provide an acute model in which to study the pathogenic mechanisms involved in D_D005901 and primary D_D005902.

title:D_D003072 from long-term abuse of C_D003915: a case report.
abstract:C_D003915 (C_D003915), the dextrorotatory isomer of C_D007981, is the main ingredient in a number of widely available, over-the-counter antitussives. Initial studies (Bornstein 1968) showed that it possessed no respiratory suppressant effects and no addiction liability. Subsequently, however, several articles reporting abuse of this drug have appeared in the literature. The drug is known to cause a variety of acute toxic effects, ranging from D_D009325, D_D011595, D_D007319, D_D001259, slurred speech and D_C564088 to mood changes, perceptual alterations, inattention, disorientation and D_D001523 (Rammer et al 1988; Katona and Watson 1986; Isbell and Fraser 1953; Devlin et al 1985; McCarthy 1971; Dodds and Revai 1967; Degkwitz 1964; Hildebrand et al 1989). There have also been two reported fatalities from C_D003915 overdoses (Fleming 1986). However, there are no reports describing the effects of chronic abuse. This report describes a case of D_D003072 resulting from prolonged use of C_D003915.

title:Long-term C_D008094 treatment and the kidney. Interim report on fifty patients.
abstract:This is a report on the first part of our study of the effects of long-term C_D008094 treatment on the kidney. C_D003404 clearance, maximum urinary osmolality and 24 hour urine volume have been tested in 50 affectively ill patients who have been on long-term C_D008094 for more than one year. These findings have been compared with norms and with values of the same tests from screening prior to C_D008094, available for most of our patients. No evidence was found for any reduction of glomerular filtration during C_D008094 treatment. Low clearance values found in several patients could be accounted for by their age and their pre-C_D008094 values. Urinary concentration defect appeared frequent but the extent of the impairment is difficult to assess because of the uncertainty about the norms applicable to this group of patients. The concentration defect appeared reversible, at least in part. D_D011141 above 3 litres/24 hours was found in 10% of patients. An attempt is made to draw practical conclusions from the preliminary findings.

title:The epidemiology of the acute D_D021501 syndrome from C_D013496.
abstract:C_D013496, a new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, was marketed in early 1986 as an analgesic agent. Until physicians began reporting an unusual acute D_D021501 syndrome to the spontaneous reporting system, 700,000 persons used the drug in the United States. Through August 1986, a total of 163 cases of this syndrome were reported. To elucidate the epidemiology of the syndrome, a case-control study was performed, comparing 62 of the case patients who had been reported to the spontaneous reporting system to 185 C_D013496-exposed control subjects who did not have the syndrome. Case patients were more likely to be men (odds ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-12.1), suffer from D_D006255 and D_D001249 (odds ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-11.9); to participate in regular exercise (odds ratio, 5.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-30.7), especially in the use of Nautilus equipment (p = 0.02); and to use C_D000431 (odds ratio, 4.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-17.5). Possible risk factors included young age, concurrent use of other analgesic agents (especially C_D007052), preexisting D_D007674, a history of D_D007669, a history of D_D006073, a recent increase in activity, a recent increase in sun exposure, and residence in the Sunbelt. These were findings that were suggestive but did not reach conventional statistical significance. These findings are consistent with the postulated mechanism for this unusual syndrome: acute diffuse crystallization of C_D014527 in renal tubules.

title:D_D006463 associated with ingestion of C_D011803.
abstract:D_D006463 following C_D011803 ingestion is a newly described phenomenon, with just two previous descriptions of 4 cases in the literature. We describe a 5th case. The reaction may be mediated by the presence of antibodies reactive against platelets in the presence of C_D011803. Treatment has included use of plasma exchange, C_D011241, C_D001241, and C_D004176. The patients have all regained some degree of renal function. However, it is unclear whether pharmacological treatment or spontaneous resolution is responsible for the improvement. C_D011803-associated D_D006463 probably occurs more often than is recognized. It is important to recognize this reaction when it occurs and to avoid further C_D011803 exposure, since the reaction seems to be recurrent.

title:Pyeloureteral filling defects associated with systemic anticoagulation: a case report.
abstract:The etiology of D_D011702 has long been attributed to chronic D_D007239 and D_D007249. A case is presented that is unique in that the acute onset and the rapid resolution of pyeloureteral filling defects in this patient were documented by radiography. There is no evidence of antecedent or concurrent D_D007239 in this patient. The disease occurred subsequent to the initiation of C_D006493 therapy for suspected pelvic D_D013924 and cleared rapidly subsequent to its discontinuation. The rate of resolution of the radiographic findings may be helpful in distinguishing between true D_D011702 and D_D006470.

title:Changes in peroxisomes in preneoplastic liver and D_D006528 of mice induced by C_D001556.
abstract:Peroxisomes in D_D006528s and hyperplastic preneoplastic D_D017093 induced in mice by 500 ppm C_D001556 were examined histochemically and electron microscopically. Although most of the D_D006528s were well-differentiated D_D009369 and contained a considerable number of peroxisomes, the D_D009369 cells did not respond to C_C012282 with proliferation of peroxisomes. At the 16th week of carcinogen feeding, hyperplastic nodules appeared and advanced to further stages. A majority of the nodules showed a considerable number of peroxisomes and the inductive proliferation of peroxisomes. Within the nodules, foci of proliferation of the cells that showed no inducibility of proliferation of peroxisomes appeared. These cells proliferated further, replacing the most part of the nodules, and with this process D_D006528s appeared to have been formed. No abnormal matrical inclusions of peroxisomes were formed in the cells of hyperplastic nodules by C_C012282 unlike in the case of rats.

title:C_D011802 D_D056486.
abstract:Long-term administration of C_D011802 was associated with persistent elevation of serum concentrations of SGOT, C_D019344 dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase. Liver biopsy showed active D_D056486. Discontinuance of C_D011802 therapy led to normalization of liver function tests. A challenge dose of C_D011802 caused clinical symptoms and abrupt elevation of SGOT, alkaline phosphatase, and C_D019344 dehydrogenase values. We concluded that this patient had C_D011802 D_D056486 and believe that this is the first case reported with liver biopsy documentation. This report also suggests that, even after long-term administration, the D_D056486 is reversible.

title:C_C013440 treatment protects rodents from the toxic effects of C_D000082, C_D004317, C_D002251, C_D002725 and C_D005688.
abstract:In addition to its use as a stabilizer/rigidifier of membranes, C_C013440, C_-1 (C_-1) administration has also been shown to protect rats from the D_D056486 effects of C_D002251 (C_D002251). To further our understanding of the mechanism of C_-1 cytoprotection, we examined in rats and mice the protective abilities of C_-1 and the non-hydrolyzable ether form of C_-1, C_C103872, C_-1 (C_-1E) against C_D000082-, C_D004317-, C_D002251-, C_D002725- and C_D005688-induced D_D064420. The results of these studies demonstrated that C_-1-mediated protection is not selective for a particular species, organ system or toxic chemical. A 24-h pretreatment of both rats and mice with a single dose of C_-1 (100mg/kg, i.p.), resulted in significant protection against the D_D056486 effects of C_D002251, C_D002725, C_D000082 and C_D005688 and against the lethal (and presumably D_D066126) effect of C_D004317 administration. Maximal C_-1-mediated protection was observed in experimental animals pretreated 24 h prior to the toxic insult. These data suggest that C_-1 intervenes in a critical cellular event that is an important common pathway to toxic cell death. The mechanism of C_-1 protection does not appear to be dependent on the inhibition of chemical bioactivation to a toxic reactive intermediate (in light of the protection observed against C_D005688 D_D056486ity). However, based on the data presented, we can not exclude the possibility that C_-1 administration inhibits chemical bioactivation. Our findings do suggest that C_-1-mediated protection is dependent on the action of the intact anionic C_-1 molecule (non-hydrolyzable C_-1E was as protective as C_-1), whose mechanism has yet to be defined.

title:DSD_D009101 XI study: dose definition for intravenous C_D003520 in combination with C_C400082/C_D003907 for remission induction in patients with newly diagnosed D_D009101.
abstract:A clinical trial was initiated to evaluate the recommended dose of C_D003520 in combination with C_C400082 and C_D003907 as induction treatment before stem cell transplantation for younger patients with newly diagnosed multiple D_D009101 (D_D009101). Thirty patients were treated with three 21-day cycles of C_C400082 1.3 mg/m(2) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 plus C_D003907 40 mg on the day of C_C400082 injection and the day after plus C_D003520 at 900, 1,200, or 1,500 mg/m(2) on day 1. The maximum tolerated dose of C_D003520 was defined as 900 mg/m(2). At this dose level, 92% of patients achieved at least a partial response. The overall response rate [complete response (CR) plus partial response (PR)] across all dose levels was 77%, with a 10% CR rate. No patient experienced progressive disease. The most frequent adverse events were hematological and gastrointestinal toxicities as well as D_D009422. The results suggest that C_C400082 in combination with C_D003520 at 900 mg/m(2) and C_D003907 is an effective induction treatment for patients with newly diagnosed D_D009101 that warrants further investigation.

title:Results of a comparative, phase III, 12-week, multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind assessment of the efficacy and tolerability of a fixed-dose combination of C_C084178 and C_D017311 versus C_D017311 monotherapy in Indian adults with stage II D_D006973.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a new fixed-dose combination (FDC) of C_C084178 40 mg + C_D017311 5 mg (T+A) compared with C_D017311 5-mg monotherapy (A) in adult Indian patients with stage II D_D006973. METHODS: This comparative, Phase III, 12-week, multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind study was conducted in Indian patients aged 18 to 65 years with established stage II D_D006973. Patients were treated with oral FDC of T+A or A QD before breakfast for 12 weeks; blood pressure (BP) and heart rate were measured in the sitting position. Primary efficacy end points were reduction in clinical systolic BP (SBP)/ diastolic BP (DBP) from baseline to study end and number of responders (ie, patients who achieved target SBP/ DBP <130/<80 mm Hg) at end of study. Tolerability was assessed by treatment-emergent adverse events, identified using physical examination, laboratory analysis, and electrocardiography. RESULTS: A total of 210 patients were enrolled in the study; 203 patients (143 men, 60 women) completed the study while 7 were lost to follow-up (4 patients in the T+A group and 3 in the A group) and considered with-drawn. At study end, statistically significant percentage reductions from baseline within groups and between groups were observed in SBP (T+A [-27.4%]; A [-16.6%]) and DBP (T+A [-20.1%]; A [-13.3%]) (all, P < 0.05). Response rates were 87.3% (89/102) in the T+A group and 69.3% (70/101) in the A group (P < 0.05). The prevalences of adverse events were not significantly different between the 2 treatment groups (T+A, 16.0% [17/106]; A, 15.4% [16/104]). Peripheral D_D004487 was reported in 8.5% patients (9/106) in the T+A group compared with 13.5% (14/104) in the A group, and D_D003371 was reported in 3.8% patients (4/106) in the T+A group and 1.0% (1/104) patients in the A group; these differences did not reach statistical significance. The incidences of D_D006261, D_D004244, and D_D003967 were similar between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among these Indian patients with stage II D_D006973, the FDC of T+A was found to be significantly more effective, with regard to BP reductions, than A, and both treatments were well tolerated.

title:D_D018366 associated with C_D010068.
abstract:A 67-year-old man who was treated with C_D010068 for one week because of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, developed D_D051437 and diffuse, symmetric, palpable D_D011693 on his feet. Necrotic blisters were noted on his fingers. Skin biopsies showed findings diagnostic of D_D018366. C_D010068 was discontinued and patient was treated with C_D000305. The D_D005076 disappeared after three weeks and renal function returned to normal. D_D018366 presents as palpable D_D011693 of the lower extremities often accompanied by D_D015746, D_D018771, and D_D007674. Etiologic factors or associated disorders include D_D007239, medications, D_D003095 and D_D009369. However, in half of the cases no etiologic factor is identified. Usually it is a self-limited disorder, but C_D000305 therapy may be needed in life-threatening cases since early treatment with C_D000305 in severe cases can prevent complications. C_D010068 should be included among the drugs that can cause D_D018366.

title:C_C024224 pretreatment modifies cardiorespiratory, temperature, and behavioral effects of C_D009020.
abstract:Behavioral and cardiorespiratory responses to a lethal dose of C_D009020 were evaluated in rats pretreated with saline or C_C024224, an antagonist of high-affinity mu 1 opioid receptors. Pretreatment with C_C024224 significantly blocked C_D009020 D_D000699, D_D002375 and D_D007035 at a dose which completely eliminated high-affinity binding in brain membranes. Moreover, C_C024224 significantly attenuated the C_D009020-induced D_D007022 and D_D012131, whereas C_D009020-induced D_D001919 was less affected. Results indicate that subpopulations of mu receptors may mediate selective behavioral and cardiorespiratory responses to C_D009020.

title:C_D064730 protects against D_D001855 from the DNA cleavage-enhancing drugs C_D005047 and C_D003630 but not C_D004317.
abstract:PURPOSE: The C_D018943 C_D003630 and C_D004317 and the C_D011034 C_D005047 are potent DNA cleavage-enhancing drugs that are widely used in clinical oncology; however, D_D001855 and D_D066126 limit their use. C_D064730 (C_D064730) is recommended for protection against C_D018943-induced D_D066126. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Because of their widespread use, the D_D006402 following coadministration of C_D064730 and these three structurally different DNA cleavage enhancers was investigated: Sensitivity of human and murine blood progenitor cells to C_D005047, C_D003630, and C_D004317 +/- C_D064730 was determined in granulocyte-macrophage colony forming assays. Likewise, in vivo, B6D2F1 mice were treated with C_D005047, C_D003630, and C_D004317, with or without C_D064730 over a wide range of doses: posttreatment, a full hematologic evaluation was done. RESULTS: Nontoxic doses of C_D064730 reduced D_D001855 and D_D015431 from C_D003630 and C_D005047 in mice and antagonized their antiproliferative effects in the colony assay; however, C_D064730 neither reduced D_D001855, D_D015431, nor the in vitro D_D064420 from C_D004317. CONCLUSION: Although our findings support the observation that C_D064730 reduces neither hematologic activity nor antitumor activity from C_D004317 clinically, the potent antagonism of C_D003630 activity raises concern; a possible interference with anticancer efficacy certainly would call for renewed attention. Our data also suggest that significant C_D005047 dose escalation is perhaps possible by the use of C_D064730. Clinical trials in patients with brain D_D009362 combining C_D064730 and high doses of C_D005047 is ongoing with the aim of improving efficacy without aggravating D_D006402. If successful, this represents an exciting mechanism for pharmacologic regulation of side effects from cytotoxic chemotherapy.

title:Effects of the novel compound C_C036466 (C_C036466) upon impaired learning and memory in rodents.
abstract:The effect of C_C036466 (C_C036466, C_C036466) was studied on various forms of experimentally D_D003072 (learning and memory) in rodents and produced the following effects: (1) almost complete prevention of the incapacity to learn a discrete escape response in rats exposed to sublethal D_D006935 immediately before the acquisition session; (2) partial (rats) or complete (mice) prevention of the C_D012601-induced short-term D_D000647 for a passive avoidance task; (3) complete protection against D_D000647 for a passive avoidance task in rats submitted to electroconvulsive shock immediately after avoidance acquisition; (4) prevention of the long-term retention- or retrieval-deficit for a passive avoidance task induced in rats and mice by C_D002701 or C_D003513 administered immediately after acquisition; (5) reversal, when administered as late as 1 h before the retention test, of the deficit in retention or retrieval of a passive avoidance task induced by C_D003513 injected 2 days previously; (6) prevention of the deficit in the retrieval of an active avoidance task induced in mice by subconvulsant electroshock or D_D006935 applied immediately before retrieval testing (24 h after acquisition). These improvements or normalizations of D_D003072 were seen at oral C_C036466 doses of 10-100 mg/kg. Generally, the dose-response curves were bell-shaped. The mechanisms underlying the activity of C_C036466 and its 'therapeutic window' are unknown. C_D010889, another C_D011760 derivative was used for comparison. It was active only in six of nine tests and had about one-tenth the potency of C_C036466. The results indicate that C_C036466 improves cognitive functions which are impaired by different procedure and in different phases of the learning and memory process.

title:C_D009538 potentiation of C_D009020-induced D_D002375 in mice.
abstract:In the present study, effects of C_D009538 on D_D002375 induced by C_D009020 in mice have been investigated. C_D009020 but not C_D009538 induced a dose-dependent D_D002375. The response of C_D009020 was potentiated by C_D009538. Intraperitoneal administration of C_D001285, C_D009270, C_D008464, and C_D018738 to mice reduced D_D002375 induced by a combination of C_D009020 with C_D009538. Intracerebroventricular injection of C_D001285, C_D018738, and C_D009270 also decreased D_D002375 induced by C_D009020 plus C_D009538. Intraperitoneal administration of C_D001285, but not intraperitoneal or intracerebroventricular injection of C_D018738, decreased the effect of a single dose of C_D009020. It was concluded that C_D009020 D_D002375 can be elicited by opioid and cholinergic receptors, and the potentiation of C_D009020 induced by C_D009538 may also be mediated through cholinergic receptor mechanisms.

title:Reduced D_D066126 and preserved antiD_D009369 efficacy of liposome-encapsulated C_D004317 and C_D003520 compared with conventional C_D004317 and C_D003520 in a randomized, multicenter trial of metastatic D_D001943.
abstract:PURPOSE: To determine whether C_D004317 (liposome-encapsulated C_D004317; The Liposome Company, Elan Corporation, Princeton, NJ) in combination with C_D003520 significantly reduces C_D004317 D_D066126 while providing comparable antiD_D009369 efficacy in first-line treatment of metastatic D_D001943 (D_D001943). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred ninety-seven patients with D_D001943 and no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were randomized to receive either 60 mg/m(2) of C_D004317 (M) or conventional C_D004317 (A), in combination with 600 mg/m(2) of C_D003520 (C), every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable D_D064420. CardioD_D064420 was defined by reductions in left-ventricular ejection fraction, assessed by serial multigated radionuclide angiography scans, or D_D006333 (D_D006333). AntiD_D009369 efficacy was assessed by objective D_D009369 response rates (World Health Organization criteria), time to progression, and survival. RESULTS: Six percent of MC patients versus 21% (including five cases of D_D006333) of AC patients developed D_D066126 (P =.0002). Median cumulative C_D004317 dose at onset was more than 2,220 mg/m(2) for MC versus 480 mg/m(2) for AC (P =.0001, hazard ratio, 5.04). MC patients also experienced less grade 4 D_D009503. AntiD_D009369 efficacy of MC versus AC was comparable: objective response rates, 43% versus 43%; median time to progression, 5.1% versus 5.5 months; median time to treatment failure, 4.6 versus 4.4 months; and median survival, 19 versus 16 months. CONCLUSION: C_D004317 improves the therapeutic index of C_D004317 by significantly reducing D_D066126 and grade 4 D_D009503 and provides comparable antiD_D009369 efficacy, when used in combination with C_D003520 as first-line therapy for D_D001943.

title:Protective effect of a specific platelet-activating factor antagonist, C_C045856, on C_D002045-induced D_D002318 in rats.
abstract:Administration of the local anaesthetic C_D002045 (1.5 or 2 mg/kg, i.v.) to rats elicited a marked decrease of mean arterial blood pressure (MBP) and heart rate (HR) leading to death (in 67% or 90% of animals respectively). Intravenous injection of the specific platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist C_C045856 (10 mg/kg), 30 min before C_D002045 administration (2 mg/kg i.v.) suppressed both the decrease of MBP and HR. In contrast, doses of 1 mg/kg C_C045856 given 30 min before or 10 mg/kg administered 5 min before i.v. injection of C_D002045 were ineffective. When C_C045856 (20 mg/kg i.v.) was injected immediately after C_D002045 (2 mg/kg), a partial reversion of the decrease of MBP and HR was observed, whereas the dose of 10 mg/kg was ineffective. A partial recovery of C_D002045-induced ECG alterations was observed after pretreatment of the rats with C_C045856. Since the administration of C_C045856, at all doses studied, did not alter MBP and HR at the doses used, the bulk of these results clearly demonstrate a protective action of C_C045856, a specific antagonist of PAF, against C_D002045-induced D_D002318. Thus, consistent with its direct effect on heart, PAF appears to be implicated in C_D002045-induced D_D018376.

title:C_C034753 reverses C_D015215-induced D_D001855 without impairment of anti-human D_D007153 virus activity.
abstract:Increased extracellular concentrations of C_D014529 (C_D014529) have been reported to reduce, in vitro, C_D015215 (C_D015215)-induced inhibition of human granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells without impairment of its antihuman D_D007153 virus (HIV) activity. Because of the clinical D_D064420 associated with chronic C_D014529 administration, the ability of benzylacycloC_D014529 (C_C034753) to effect, in vivo, C_D015215-induced D_D000740 and D_D007970 was assessed. This agent inhibits C_D014529 catabolism and, in vivo, increases the plasma concentration of C_D014529 in a dose-dependent manner, without C_D014529-related D_D064420. In mice rendered D_D000740 and D_D007970 by the administration of C_D015215 for 28 days in drinking water (1.5 mg/mL), the continued administration of C_D015215 plus daily C_C034753 (300 mg/kg, orally) partially reversed C_D015215-induced D_D000740 and D_D007970 (P less than .05), increased peripheral reticulocytes (to 4.9%, P less than .01), increased cellularity in the marrow, and improved D_-1. When coadministered with C_D015215 from the onset of drug administration, C_C034753 reduced C_D015215-induced marrow D_D064420. In vitro, at a concentration of 100 mumol/L, C_C034753 possesses minimal anti-HIV activity and has no effect on the ability of C_D015215 to reverse the HIV-induced cytopathic effect in MT4 cells. The clinical and biochemical implications of these findings are discussed.

title:C_D003520-induced D_D003556 in freely-moving conscious rats: behavioral approach to a new model of D_D059265.
abstract:PURPOSE: To develop a model of D_D059265 in rats using a behavioral approach. C_D003520 (C_D003520), an antitumoral agent known to produce toxic effects on the bladder wall through its main toxic metabolite C_D000171, was used to induce D_D003556. MATERIALS AND METHODS: C_D003520 was administered at doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg./kg. i.p. to male rats, and their behavior observed and scored. The effects of C_D009020 (0.5 to 4 mg./kg. i.v.) on C_D003520-induced behavioral modifications were tested administered alone and after C_D009270 (1 mg./kg. s.c.). In addition, 90 minutes after C_D003520 injection, that is, at the time of administration of C_D009020, the bladder was removed in some rats for histological examination. Finally, to show that the bladder is essential for the C_D003520-induced behavioral modifications, female rats also received C_D003520 at doses of 200 mg./kg. i.p. and of 20 mg. by the intravesical route, and C_D000171 at doses of 0.5 mg. by the intravesical route and of 5 mg./kg. i.v. RESULTS: C_D003520 dose-relatedly induced marked behavioral modifications in male rats: breathing rate decrease, closing of the eyes and occurrence of specific postures. C_D009020 dose-dependently reversed these D_D001523. A dose of 0.5 mg./kg. produced a reduction of almost 50% of the behavioral score induced by C_D003520 200 mg./kg. This effect was completely prevented by pretreatment with C_D009270. At the time of administration of C_D009020, histological modifications of the bladder wall, such as chorionic and muscle layer D_D004487, were observed. In female rats, C_D003520 200 mg./kg. i.p. produced the same marked behavioral modifications as those observed in male rats. Administered at the dose of 20 mg. intravesically, C_D003520 did not produce any behavioral effects, whereas C_D000171 at 0.5 mg. intravesically induced behavioral modifications identical to those under C_D003520 200 mg./kg. i.p., with the same maximal levels. Conversely, C_D000171 5 mg./kg. i.v. did not produce any behavioral effects at all. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results indicate that this experimental model of C_D003520-induced D_D003556 may be an interesting new behavioral model of inflammatory D_D059265, allowing a better understanding of these D_D010146 and thus a better therapeutic approach to them.

title:D_D006930 and D_D009207 in terminal D_D009369 patients treated with continuous intravenous C_D009020.
abstract:Eight D_D009369 patients in the terminal stages of the disease treated with high doses of intravenous C_D009020 developed D_D006930. All cases were retrospectively sampled from three different hospitals in Copenhagen. Five patients developed universal D_D006930 and D_D006941 which in 2 cases were accompanied by D_D009207. In 3 patients a pre-existing D_D009437 increased to excruciating intensity and in 2 of these cases D_D009207 occurred simultaneously. Although only few clinical descriptions of the relationship between D_D006930/D_D009207 and high doses of C_D009020 are available, experimental support from animal studies indicates that C_D009020, or its metabolites, plays a causative role for the observed behavioural syndrome. The possible mechanisms are discussed and treatment proposals given suggesting the use of more efficacious opioids with less excitatory potency in these situations.

title:A prospective study of adverse reactions associated with C_D014640 therapy.
abstract:A prospective evaluation of the efficacy and safety of C_D014640 was conducted in 54 consecutive patients over a 16-month period. C_D014640 was curative in 95% of 43 patients with proven D_D007239. Drugs were ceased in six patients because of adverse reactions; in three of these C_D014640 was considered the likely cause. Reactions included D_D013924 (20 of 54 patients), D_D005076 (4 of 54), D_D007674 (4 of 50), D_D011507 (1 of 50) and D_D006311 (1 of 11 patients tested by audiometry). D_D013924 occurred only with infusion through peripheral cannulae; D_D007674 and D_D006311 were confined to patients receiving an C_D000617 plus C_D014640. We conclude that C_D014640, administered appropriately, constitutes safe, effective therapy for D_D007239s caused by susceptible bacteria.

abstract:1. The D_D002375 induced by C_D004298 antagonists has been tested and the possible C_D004298 subtypes involved in D_D002375 was determined. 2. C_D004298 antagonist C_D005476, D-1 antagonist C_C534628 or D-2 antagonist C_D013469 induced D_D002375. The effect of C_D005476 and C_D013469 was dose-dependent. Combination of C_C534628 with C_D013469 did not induce D_D002375 potentiation. 3. D-1 agonist C_D015647 or D-2 agonist C_D019257 decreased the D_D002375 induced by C_D005476, C_C534628 or C_D013469. 4. Combination of C_D015647 with C_D019257 did not cause potentiated inhibitory effect on D_D002375 induced by C_D004298 antagonists. 5. The data may indicate that although D-2 receptor blockade is involved in D_D002375, the D-1 receptor may plan a role.

title:C_D003911-C_D017308 conjugates: synthesis, in vitro and in vivo evaluation.
abstract:C_D017308 (C_D017308), is a non-narcotic analgesic and antiinflammatory drug. A biodegradable polymer C_D003911 has been utilized as a carrier for synthesis of C_D017308-C_D003911 conjugates (C_D017308D) to improve its aqueous solubility and reduce gastrointestinal side effects. An activated moiety, i.e. C_-1 derivative of C_D017308 (C_D017308AI), was condensed with the polysaccharide polymer C_D003911 of different molecular weights (40000, 60000, 110000 and 200000). IR spectral data confirmed formation of ester bonding in the conjugates. C_D017308 contents were evaluated by UV-spectrophotometric analysis. The molecular weights were determined by measuring viscosity using the Mark-Howink-Sakurada equation. In vitro hydrolysis of C_D017308D was done in aqueous buffers (pH 1.2, 7.4, 9) and in 80% (v/v) human plasma (pH 7.4). At pH 9, a higher rate of C_D017308 release from C_D017308D was observed as compared to aqueous buffer of pH 7.4 and 80% human plasma (pH 7.4), following first-order kinetics. In vivo investigations were performed in animals. Acute analgesic and antiinflammatory activities were ascertained using C_D019342 induced D_D010146 model (mice) and C_D002351-induced rat paw D_D004487 model, respectively. In comparison to control, C_D017308 and C_D017308D1-C_D017308D4 showed highly significant analgesic and antiinflammatory activities (p <0.001). Biological evaluation suggested that conjugates (C_D017308D1-C_D017308D4) retained comparable analgesic and antiinflammatory activities with remarkably reduced ulcerogenicity as compared to their parent drug--C_D017308.

The 47-year-old female patient, known to have D_D002312, was admitted with D_D018754 and managed aggressively with C_D004280 infusion and other drugs while being assessed for heart transplantation. On transthoracic echocardiogram, she had moderate D_D018487 with regional variability and moderate D_D008944. The recipient's heart showed the features of apical D_D002312 and D_D009205 with abundant eosinophils. D_D009205 is rare and D_D004802 D_D009205 is rarer. It is likely that the D_D004342 (D_D004802) D_D009205 was related to C_D004280 infusion therapy. Eosinophilic D_D009205 has been reported with an incidence of 2.4% to 7.2% in explanted hearts and may be related to multidrug therapy.

title:C_D014212-induced D_D004893 in patients with D_D015473.
abstract:D_D004893 associated with C_D014212 (C_D014212) for D_D015473 (D_D015473) is very rare. We describe four patients with classic D_D015473 who developed D_D004893 during C_D014212 therapy. D_D005334 and subsequent multiple D_D010146 D_D004893 over extremities developed on D11, D16, D17, and D19, respectively, after C_D014212 therapy. The skin biopsy taken from each patient was consistent with D_D004893. All patients received short course of C_D013256. D_D005334 subsided rapidly and the skin lesions regressed completely. All patients achieved complete remission without withdrawal of C_D014212. C_D014212 seemed to be the most possible etiology of D_D004893 in our patients. Short-term use of C_D013256 is very effective in C_D014212-induced D_D004893.

title:Delayed-onset C_D006493-induced D_D013921.
abstract:BACKGROUND: C_D006493-induced D_D013921 presents 5 to 12 days after C_D006493 exposure, with or without arterial or venous thromboemboli. Delayed recognition and treatment of C_D006493-induced D_D013921 contribute to poor patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To describe and increase awareness of a clinical scenario in which the onset or manifestations of C_D006493-induced D_D013921 are delayed. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: Three large urban hospitals (with active cardiovascular surgery programs). PATIENTS: 14 patients seen over a 3-year period in whom C_D006493-induced D_D013921 became apparent on delayed presentation with D_D013923 complications. MEASUREMENTS: Platelet counts, onset of objectively determined D_D013923, results of C_D006493-induced platelet factor 4 antibody tests, and outcomes. RESULTS: Patients went home after hospitalizations that had included C_D006493 exposure--in most cases, with no D_D013921 recognized--only to return to the hospital (median, day 14) with D_D013923 complications. D_D013923 were venous (12 patients, 7 with D_D011655) or arterial (4 patients) or both. Platelet counts were mildly decreased in all but 2 patients on second presentation. On readmission, 11 patients received therapeutic C_D006493, which worsened the patients' clinical condition and, in all 11 cases, decreased the platelet count (mean at readmission, 143 x 10(9) cells/L; mean nadir after C_D006493 re-exposure, 39 x 10(9) cells/L). Results of serologic tests for C_D006493-induced antibodies were positive in all patients. Subsequent treatments included alternative anticoagulants (11 patients), thrombolytic drugs (3 patients), inferior vena cava filters (3 patients) and, eventually, C_D014859 (11 patients). Three patients died. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed-onset C_D006493-induced D_D013921 is increasingly being recognized. To avoid disastrous outcomes, physicians must consider C_D006493-induced D_D013921 whenever a recently hospitalized patient returns with D_D013923; therapy with alternative anticoagulants, not C_D006493, should be initiated.

title:C_C081489, a new C_D000804 antagonist for the treatment of essential D_D006973: a comparative study of the efficacy and safety against C_D017311.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: To compare the antihypertensive efficacy of a new C_D000804 antagonist, C_C081489, with a reference therapy, C_D017311. METHODS: One hundred sixty-eight adult outpatients with mild to moderate D_D006973 were randomly allocated in double-blind fashion and equal number to receive 80 mg C_C081489 or 5 mg C_D017311 for 12 weeks. After 8 weeks of therapy, in patients whose blood pressure remained uncontrolled, 5 mg C_D017311 was added to the initial therapy. Patients were assessed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was change from baseline in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure at 8 weeks. Secondary variables included change in sitting systolic blood pressure and responder rates. RESULTS: Both C_C081489 and C_D017311 were effective at lowering blood pressure at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Similar decreases were observed in both groups, with no statistically significant differences between the groups for any variable analyzed. For the primary variable the difference was 0.5 mm Hg in favor of C_C081489 (p = 0.68; 95% confidence interval, -2.7 to 1.7). Responder rates at 8 weeks were 66.7% for C_C081489 and 60.2% for C_D017311 (p = 0.39). Both treatments were well tolerated. The incidence of drug-related dependent D_D004487 was somewhat higher in the C_D017311 group, particularly at a dose of 10 mg per day (2.4% for 80 mg C_C081489; 3.6% for 5 mg C_D017311; 0% for C_C081489 plus 5 mg C_D017311; 14.3% for 10 mg C_D017311). CONCLUSIONS: The data show that C_C081489 is at least as effective as C_D017311 in the treatment of mild to moderate D_D006973. The results also show C_C081489 to be well tolerated and suggest that it is not associated with side effects characteristic of this comparator class, C_C038806 C_D002118 antagonists.

title:C_C081198: a novel selective C_D000241 A2A receptor antagonist with antiD_D002375 activity.
abstract:C_C081198 is a novel selective C_D000241 A2A receptor antagonist. Oral administration of C_C081198 (2.5, 10.0 and 30.0 mg/kg) significantly ameliorated the D_D002375 responses induced by intracerebroventricular administration of an C_D000241 A2A receptor agonist, C_C061282 (10 micrograms), in a dose-dependent manner. C_C081198 also reduced the D_D002375 induced by C_D006220 (1 mg/kg i.p.) and by C_D012110 (5 mg/kg i.p.). These antiD_D002375 effects were exhibited dose dependently at doses from 0.625 and 2.5 mg/kg p.o., respectively. Moreover, C_C081198 (0.625 mg/kg p.o.) potentiated the antiD_D002375 effects of a subthreshold dose of C_D007980 (C_D007980; 25 mg/kg i.p.) plus C_D001545 (6.25 mg/kg i.p.). These results suggested that C_C081198 is a centrally active C_D000241 A2A receptor antagonist and that the dopaminergic function of the nigrostriatal pathway is potentiated by C_D000241 A2A receptor antagonists. Furthermore, C_C081198 may be a useful drug in the treatment of D_D010302.

title:Some central effects of repeated treatment with C_D016666.
abstract:We investigated the effect of repeated treatment with C_D016666, a selective C_D012701 uptake inhibitor, on behavioral effects of dopaminomimetics and C_D008729 and on the animal behavior in the "behavioral despair" test. A repeated treatment with C_D016666 (twice daily for 14 days) potentiated in mice and in rats (weaker) the C_D000661-induced D_D006948. The D_D006948 induced by C_D009627 in mice remained unaffected by C_D016666. The stimulation of locomotor activity by intracerebroventricularly administered C_D008729 was not affected by repeated treatment with C_D016666. Given three times C_D016666 had no effect on the immobilization time in the "behavioral despair" test in rats. The results indicate that C_D016666 given repeatedly acts differently than C_D015283, another selective C_D012701 uptake inhibitor, and differs also from other antidepressant drugs.

title:Severe D_D006333 patient on C_D000638 presenting with myxedemic coma: a case report.
abstract:This is a case report of myxedema coma secondary to C_D000638-induced D_D007037 in a patient with severe D_D006333 (D_D006333). To our knowledge and after reviewing the literature there is one case report of myxedema coma during long term C_D000638 therapy. Myxedema coma is a life threatening condition that carries a mortality reaching as high as 20% with treatment. The condition is treated with intravenous C_D013974 (C_D013974) or intravenous C_D014284 (C_D014284). Patients with D_D006333 on C_D000638 may suffer serious morbidity and mortality from D_D007037, and thus may deserve closer follow up for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. This case report carries an important clinical application given the frequent usage of C_D000638 among D_D006333 patients. The myriad clinical presentation of myxedema coma and its serious morbidity and mortality stresses the need to suspect this clinical syndrome among D_D006333 patients presenting with D_D007022, D_D018908 or other unexplained symptoms.

title:Fear-potentiated D_D012021, but not light-enhanced D_D012021, is enhanced by anxiogenic drugs.
abstract:RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The light-enhanced D_D012021 paradigm (LES) is suggested to model D_D001008, because of the non-specific cue and the long-term effect. In contrast, the fear-potentiated D_D012021 (FPS) is suggested to model conditioned fear. However, the pharmacological profiles of these two paradigms are very similar. The present study investigated the effects of putative anxiogenic drugs on LES and FPS and aimed at determining the sensitivity of LES for anxiogenic drugs and to potentially showing a pharmacological differentiation between these two paradigms. METHODS: Male Wistar rats received each dose of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist C_D015016 (0.25-1.0mg/kg), the C_D012701(2C) receptor agonist C_C015068 (C_C015068, 0.5-2.0mg/kg) or the C_D005680(A) inverse receptor agonist C_D010433 (C_D010433, 3-30mg/kg) and were subsequently tested in either LES or FPS. RESULTS: None of the drugs enhanced LES, whereas C_C015068 increased percentage FPS and C_D015016 increased absolute FPS values. Furthermore, C_D015016 increased baseline D_D012021 amplitude in the LES, while C_C015068 suppressed baseline D_D012021 in both the LES and FPS and C_D010433 suppressed baseline D_D012021 in the FPS. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to findings in the FPS paradigm, none of the drugs were able to exacerbate the LES response. Thus, a clear pharmacological differentiation was found between LES and FPS.

title:Proteinase 3-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-(PR3-ANCA) positive necrotizing D_D005921 after restarting C_D012460 treatment.
abstract:A 59-year-old woman with D_D003093 developed D_D005128, D_D010996, D_D004802 and D_D001745 after restarting of C_D012460 treatment. Light microscopy of a kidney biopsy revealed segmental necrotizing D_D005921 without deposition of immunoglobulin or complement. Proteinase 3-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (PR3-ANCA) titer was elevated at 183 ELISA units (EU) in sera (normal range less than 10 EU), myeloperoxidase-ANCA was negative. PR3-ANCA titer was 250 and 1,070 EU in D_D010996s on right and left side, respectively. Although cessation of C_D012460 treatment resulted in improvements in D_D005334, D_D005128, D_D002637, titer of C-reactive protein and volume of the D_D010996s, we initiated C_D013256 therapy, because PR3-ANCA titer rose to 320 EU, eosinophil count increased to 1,100 cells/microl, and the D_D010996 remained. One month after C_D013256 therapy, the D_D010996 disappeared, and PR3-ANCA titer normalized 3 months later. This case suggests that C_D012460 can induce PR3-ANCA-positive necrotizing D_D005921.

title:Is C_D010672 administration safe in a D_D007035 child?
abstract:A male neonate with a D_D001139 and a leaking myelomeningocoele underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion followed by repair of myelomeningocoele. During anaesthesia and surgery, he inadvertently became moderately D_D007035. Intravenous C_D010672 was administered during the later part of the surgery for D_D012640 prophylaxis. Following C_D010672 administration, the patient developed acute severe D_D001919, refractory to C_D001285 and C_D004837. The cardiac depressant actions of C_D010672 and D_D007035 can be additive. Administration of C_D010672 in the presence of D_D007035 may lead to an adverse cardiac event in children. As C_D010672 is a commonly used drug, clinicians need to be aware of this interaction.

title:C_C012052 related D_D013981 in an adolescent D_D012559.
abstract:D_D013981 can be effectively treated by atypical antipsychotics such as C_D018967, C_C076029 and C_C092292. However, there are two case reports that show D_D013981, including motor and phonic variants, occurring during treatment with C_C069541 or C_D003024. We present a 15-year-old girl D_D012559 who developed frequent D_D020820 after 5 months of C_C012052 treatment (1000 mg per day). The D_D013981 resolved completely after we reduced the dose of C_C012052 down to 800 mg per day. However, her D_D011605 recurred after the dose reduction. We then placed her on an additional 100 mg per day of C_C069541. She has been in complete remission under the combined medications for more than one year and maintains a fair role function. No more D_D013981 or other side effects have been reported. Together with previously reported cases, our patient suggests that D_D013981 might occur in certain vulnerable individuals during treatment with atypical antipsychotics such as C_C069541, C_D003024, or C_C012052.

title:Comparison of developmental toxicology of C_D001241 (C_D001241) in rats using selected dosing paradigms.
abstract:BACKGROUND: Analysis of the literature for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) suggests that a low incidence of D_D000014 occurs in rats given NSAIDs on specific days during organogenesis. C_D001241 (C_D001241 [C_D001241]), an irreversible cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 inhibitor, induces D_D000014 when administered to Wistar rats on gestational day (GD) 9, 10, or 11 (Kimmel CA, Wilson JG, Schumacher HJ. Teratology 4:15-24, 1971). There are no published C_D001241 studies using the multiple dosing paradigm of GDs 6 to 17. Objectives of the current study were to compare results between Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Wistar strains when C_D001241 is administered on GD 9, 10, or 11; to compare the malformation patterns following single and multiple dosings during organogenesis in SD rats; and to test the hypothesis that maternal D_D005767 confounds the detection of low incidence D_D000014 with C_D001241 when a multiple dosing paradigm is used. METHODS: C_D001241 was administered as a single dose on GD 9 (0, 250, 500, or 625 mg/kg), 10 (0, 500, 625, or 750 mg/kg), or 11 (0, 500, 750, or 1000 mg/kg) and from GD 6 to GD 17 (0, 50, 125, or 250 mg/kg a day) in the multiple dose study to SD rats. Animals were killed on GD 21, and fetuses were examined viscerally. RESULTS: The literature evaluation suggested that NSAIDs induce D_D006345 (D_D006345) and D_D009436 (D_D009436) in rats and D_D065630 (D_D065630), D_D009436, and D_D006345 in rabbits (Cook JC et al., 2003); hence, the present study focused on these D_D000014, even though C_D001241 induces several other low-incidence D_D000014. In single dose studies, D_D065630, D_D009436, and D_D006345 were induced on GDs 9 and 10. D_D006345 also was noted following treatment on GD 11. In contrast, D_D065630 and D_D009436 were noted in the multiple dose study design only in the high-dose group, and D_D006345 was noted across all dose groups. CONCLUSIONS: High concordance in major D_D000014 between Wistar and SD rats were noted with the exception of D_D006345 in the SD rats and D_D006849 in the Wistar rats. Variations and D_D000014 were similar when C_D001241 was administered as a single dose or during the period of organogenesis (GDs 6 to 17). It was also evident that, by titrating the dose to achieve a maximum tolerated dose, D_D000014 that normally occur at low incidence, as reported from previous single dose studies, could also be induced with C_D001241 given at multiple doses.

abstract:There is a growing list of drugs implicated in acquired D_D008133 and D_D016171. However, the torsadogenic potential of C_D008787, a commonly used antiemetic and prokinetic drug, has not been reported in the literature, despite its chemical similarity to C_D011342. We report on a 92-year-old woman with preexisting complete D_D002037 who developed D_D016171 after intravenous and oral administration of C_D008787. This patient also developed D_D016171 when C_D020117 and C_D004917 were given simultaneously. These two episodes were suppressed successfully after discontinuing the offending drugs and administering class IB drugs. This is the first documentation that C_D008787 provokes D_D016171 clinically. C_D008787 should be used cautiously in patients with a risk of D_D016171.

title:C_D001058: an underutilized therapy for D_D010300.
abstract:C_D001058 was the first C_D004298rgic drug ever used to treat symptoms of D_D010300. While powerful antiparkinsonian effects had been observed as early as 1951, the potential of treating fluctuating D_D010300 by subcutaneous administration of C_D001058 has only recently become the subject of systematic study. A number of small scale clinical trials have unequivocally shown that intermittent subcutaneous C_D001058 injections produce antiparkinsonian benefit close if not identical to that seen with C_D007980 and that C_D001058 rescue injections can reliably revert off-periods even in patients with complex on-off motor swings. Continuous subcutaneous C_D001058 infusions can reduce daily off-time by more than 50% in this group of patients, which appears to be a stronger effect than that generally seen with add-on therapy with oral C_D004298 agonists or COMT inhibitors. Extended follow-up studies of up to 8 years have demonstrated long-term persistence of C_D001058 efficacy. In addition, there is convincing clinical evidence that monotherapy with continuous subcutaneous C_D001058 infusions is associated with marked reductions of preexisting C_D007980-induced D_D004409. The main side effects of subcutaneous C_D001058 treatment are related to cutaneous tolerability problems, whereas sedation and D_D001523 complications play a lesser role. Given the marked degree of efficacy of subcutaneous C_D001058 treatment in fluctuating D_D010300, this approach seems to deserve more widespread clinical use.

title:Fatal excited D_D003693 following C_D003042 use: epidemiologic findings provide new evidence for mechanisms of C_D003042 D_D064420.
abstract:We describe an outbreak of deaths from C_D003042-induced excited D_D003693 (D_D003693) in Dade County, Florida between 1979 and 1990. From a registry of all C_D003042-related deaths in Dade County, Florida, from 1969-1990, 58 D_D003693 were compared with 125 victims of accidental C_D003042 D_D062787 without excited D_D003693. Compared with controls, D_D003693 were more frequently black, male, and younger. They were less likely to have a low body mass index, and more likely to have died in police custody, to have received medical treatment immediately before death, to have survived for a longer period, to have developed D_D005334, and to have died in summer months. D_D003693 had concentrations of C_D003042 and C_C005618 in autopsy blood that were similar to those for controls. The epidemiologic findings are most consistent with the hypothesis that chronic C_D003042 use disrupts dopaminergic function and, when coupled with recent C_D003042 use, may precipitate D_D011595, D_D003693, aberrant thermoregulation, D_D012206, and D_D003645.

Clinical manifestations of this disorder include D_D006470 or, more frequently, D_D013923 events in patients receiving C_D006493. Laboratory testing has revealed D_D001791, increased resistance to C_D006493, and aggregation of platelets by the patient's plasma when C_D006493 is added. Immunologic testing has demonstrated the presence of a C_D006493-dependent platelet membrane antibody. The 20 deaths, 52 hemorrhagic and D_D013923 complications, and 21 surgical procedures to manage the complications confirm the seriousness of the disorder. Specific risk factors have not been identified; therefore, all patients receiving C_D006493 should be monitored. If the platelet count falls to less than 100,000/mm3, while the patient is receiving C_D006493, D_D001791 testing, using the patient's plasma, is indicated. Management consists of cessation of C_D006493, platelet anti-aggregating agents, and alternate forms of anticoagulation when indicated.

title:D_D066126 of C_D005472. Report of a case of spontaneous D_D000787.
abstract:We report a case of a patient with D_D003110 and liver D_D009362 who presented D_D002637 after C_D005472 (C_D005472) administration. Clinical electrocardiographic evolution was similar to that observed in Prinzmetal's D_D000787, and D_D002637 promptly resolved with C_D009543. These data suggest that D_D003329 may be the cause of D_D066126 due to C_D005472, and that C_D002118 antagonists may probably be used in the prevention or treatment of C_D005472 D_D066126.

abstract:Twenty-five patients with D_D001172 (D_D001172) who developed D_D064420 while taking remission inducing drugs and 30 without D_D064420 were studied for possible associations with class I and II HLA antigens. A strong association has been found between D_D009393 and D_D003872 due to C_D008625 (a C_D010396 like compound) and class I antigens B35-Cw4, and between D_D003872 due to C_D006046 C_-1 and B35. Compared to healthy controls a lower DR5 frequency was observed in patients with D_D001172 except for the C_D008625 related D_D009393 group.

abstract:Among the common side effects of C_D010672 (C_D010672) D_D062787, the most frequently encountered neurological signs are those of D_D002526. Very rarely, the toxic neurological manifestations of this drug are of cerebral origin. Two patients are presented who suffered progressive D_D010291 due to C_D010672 D_D062787. Both had brain surgery before C_D010672 treatment. It is assumed that patients with some D_D001927 are liable to manifest C_D010672 D_D064420 as focal neurological signs.

title:Nerve growth factor and C_D011453 in the urine of female patients with D_D053201.
abstract:PURPOSE: NGF and C_D011453 in the bladder can be affected by pathological changes in the bladder and these changes can be detected in urine. We investigated changes in urinary NGF and C_D011453 in women with D_D053201. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study groups included 65 women with D_D053201 and 20 without bladder symptoms who served as controls. Evaluation included patient history, urinalysis, a voiding diary and urodynamic studies. Urine samples were collected. NGF, C_D015232, C_D015237 and C_D011464 were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and compared between the groups. In addition, correlations between urinary NGF and C_D011453, and urodynamic parameters in patients with D_D053201 were examined. RESULTS: Urinary NGF, C_D015232 and C_D015237 were significantly increased in patients with D_D053201 compared with controls (p <0.05). However, urinary C_D011464 was not different between controls and patients with D_D053201. In patients with D_D053201 urinary C_D015232 positively correlated with volume at first desire to void and maximum cystometric capacity (p <0.05). Urinary NGF, C_D015237 and C_D011464 did not correlate with urodynamic parameters in patients with D_D053201. CONCLUSIONS: NGF and C_D011453 have important roles in the development of D_D053201 symptoms in female patients. Urinary levels of these factors may be used as markers to evaluate D_D053201 symptoms.

title:Acute D_D017116 during intravenous administration of C_D000638: a report of two cases.
abstract:C_D000638 represents an effective antiarrhythmic drug for cardioversion of recent-onset D_D001281 (D_D001281) and maintenance of sinus rhythm. We briefly describe two patients suffering from recent-onset D_D001281, who experienced an acute devastating D_D017116 a few minutes after initiation of intravenous C_D000638 loading. Notably, this side effect has not been ever reported in the medical literature. Clinicians should be aware of this reaction since prompt termination of parenteral administration leads to complete resolution.

title:D_D010149 after C_D013390: no evidence for an inflammatory origin.
abstract:A common side effect associated with C_D013390 is D_D010149. The pathogenesis of this D_D063806 is still unclear; D_D007249 has been suggested but without convincing evidence. We designed the present study to investigate whether an inflammatory reaction contributes to this D_D063806. The incidence and severity of C_D013390-associated D_D063806 was determined in 64 patients pretreated with saline or C_D003907 before C_D013390 (n = 32 for each). Incidence and severity of D_D063806 did not differ significantly between the two groups: 15 patients in the C_D003907 group complained of D_D063806 compared with 18 patients in the saline group, and severe D_D063806 was reported by five patients and three patients, respectively (not significant). At 48 h after surgery, 12 patients in both groups still suffered from D_D063806 (not significant). In addition, interleukin-6 (IL-6) as an early marker of D_D007249 was assessed in a subgroup of 10 patients pretreated with saline. We found an increase of IL-6 for only three patients, but only one patient reported D_D063806; no relationship between D_D063806 and the increase of IL-6 was found. In conclusion, there is no evidence for an inflammatory origin of C_D013390-associated D_D063806. IMPLICATIONS: Administration of C_D003907 before C_D013390 was not effective in decreasing the incidence or the severity of C_D013390-induced D_D010149. Furthermore, there was no significant relationship between D_D010149 and time course of interleukin-6 concentrations, a marker of D_D007249. Pretreatment with C_D003907 is not justified to prevent D_D010149 after C_D013390.

In this report we describe an unusual case of reversible C_D007980-induced Oromandibular D_D004421 (D_D008538) in a D_D013494 patient to highlight the importance of recognizing this drug related complication in the management of D_D013494, and discuss the possible underlying pathophysiology.

title:Protective effect of C_C005435 against C_D013307-induced D_D015837 in the guinea pig.
abstract:This study investigated alleviation of C_D013307-induced D_D015837 by C_C005435 in guinea pigs. C_C005435, a free radical scavenger, has potent free radical quenching action and is used in clinical practice to treat D_D002544. C_D013307 was administered to the inner ear by osmotic pump for 24 h, and C_C005435 (n=8) or saline (n=6) was intraperitoneally injected once a day for 7 days. We observed horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex as a marker of postoperative vestibular function. Animals injected with saline showed statistically smaller gains than those injected with C_C005435. These results suggest that C_C005435 suppresses C_D013307-induced D_D015837.

title:C_D007649 in war/tropical surgery (a final tribute to the racemic mixture).
abstract:A technique of continuous intravenous anaesthesia with C_D007649 was used successfully during the Somalia civil war in 1994 and in north Uganda in 1999 for 64 operations in 62 patients, aged from 6 weeks to 70 years, undergoing limb and abdominal surgery including caesarian sections and interventions in neonates. Operations lasting up to 2h could be performed in the absence of sophisticated equipment such as pulse oximeters or ventilators in patients on spontaneous ventilation breathing air/C_D010100 only. After premedication with C_D003975, C_D006024 and local anaesthesia, and induction with standard doses of C_D007649, a maintenance dose of 10-20 microg/kg/min of C_D007649 proved safe and effective. Emphasis was placed on bedside clinical monitoring, relying heavily on the heart rate. C_D003975, unless contraindicated or risky, remains the only necessary complementary drug to C_D007649 as it buffers its cardiovascular response and decreases the duration and intensity of operative and postoperative D_D006212. Local anaesthetic blocks were useful in decreasing the requirement for postoperative D_D000699. An antisialogue was usually unnecessary in operations lasting up to 2 h, C_D006024 being the best choice for its lowest psychotropic and chronotropic effects, especially in a hot climate. Experience in war/tropical settings suggests this technique could be useful in civilian contexts such as outdoor life-saving emergency surgery or in mass casualties where, e.g. amputation and rapid extrication were required.

title:C_D013256 structure and pharmacological properties determine the anti-D_D000647 effects of C_C018370 in the passive avoidance task in rats.
abstract:C_C018370 (C_C018370) has generated interest as one of the most potent memory-enhancing neuroC_D013256s to be examined in rodent learning studies, with particular importance in the ageing process. The mechanism by which this endogenous C_D013256 enhances memory formation is hypothesized to involve actions on glutamatergic and C_D005680ergic systems. This hypothesis stems from findings that C_C018370 is a potent positive modulator of C_D016202 receptors (C_D016202Rs) and a negative modulator of C_D005680(A) receptors (C_D005680(A)Rs). Moreover, C_C018370 is able to reverse the D_D000647-like effects of C_D016202R and C_D005680(A)R ligands. To investigate this hypothesis, the present study in rats examined the memory-altering abilities of structural analogs of C_C018370, which differ in their modulation of C_D016202R and/or C_D005680(A)R function. The analogs tested were: 11-ketoC_C018370 (an agent that is inactive at C_D005680(A)Rs and C_D016202Rs), C_C018370, an inhibitor of both C_D005680(A)Rs and C_D016202Rs), and a newly synthesized (-) C_C018370 enantiomer (which is identical to C_C018370 in effects on C_D005680(A)Rs and C_D016202Rs). The memory-enhancing effects of C_C018370 and its analogs were tested in the passive avoidance task using the model of C_D012601-induced D_D000647. Both C_C018370 and its (-) enantiomer blocked the effects of C_D012601. The results show that, unlike C_C018370, 11-ketoC_C018370 and C_C018370 failed to block the effect of C_D012601, suggesting that altering the modulation of C_D016202 receptors diminishes the memory-enhancing effects of C_C018370. Moreover, enantioselectivity was demonstrated by the ability of natural C_C018370 to be an order of magnitude more effective than its synthetic enantiomer in reversing C_D012601-induced D_D000647. These results identify a novel neuropharmacological site for the modulation of memory processes by neuroactive C_D013256s.

title:Preliminary efficacy assessment of intrathecal injection of an American formulation of C_D000241 in humans.
abstract:BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies of intrathecal C_D000241 suggest it may be effective in the treatment of acute and chronic D_D010146 in humans, and preliminary studies in volunteers and patients with a Swedish formulation of C_D000241 suggests it may be effective in D_D004342 states but not with acute noxious stimulation. The purpose of this study was to screen for efficacy of a different formulation of C_D000241 marketed in the US, using both acute noxious stimulation and C_D002211-evoked mechanical D_D004342. METHODS: Following Food and Drug Administration and institutional review board approval and written informed consent, 65 volunteers were studied in two trials: an open-label, dose-escalating trial with intrathecal C_D000241 doses of 0.25-2.0 mg and a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of C_D000241, 2 mg. Cerebrospinal fluid was obtained for pharmacokinetic analysis, and D_D010146 ratings in response to acute heat stimuli and areas of D_D006930 and D_D006930 after intradermal C_D002211 injection were determined. RESULTS: C_D000241 produced no effect on D_D010146 report to acute noxious thermal or chemical stimulation but reduced D_D006930 and D_D006930 from intradermal C_D002211 injection for at least 24 h. In contrast, residence time of C_D000241 in cerebrospinal fluid was short (< 4 h). CONCLUSIONS: These results show selective inhibition by intrathecal C_D000241 of D_D004342, presumed to reflect central sensitization in humans after peripheral C_D002211 injection. The long-lasting effect is consistent with that observed in preliminary reports of patients with chronic neuropathic D_D010146 and is not due to prolonged residence of C_D000241 in cerebrospinal fluid.

title:Effect of C_D008094 maintenance therapy on thyroid and parathyroid function.
abstract:OBJECTIVES: To assess changes induced by C_D008094 maintenance therapy on the incidence of thyroid, parathyroid and ion alterations. These were evaluated with respect to the duration of C_D008094 therapy, age, sex, and family history (whether or not the patient had a first-degree relative with D_D013959). DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Affective Disorders Clinic at St. Mary's Hospital, Montreal. PATIENTS: One hundred and one patients (28 men and 73 women) with D_D001714 receiving C_D008094 maintenance therapy ranging from 1 year's to 32 years' duration. The control group consisted of 82 patients with no D_D001523 or endocrinological diagnoses from the hospital's out-patient clinics. OUTCOME MEASURES: Laboratory analyses of C_D002118, C_D008274 and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels performed before beginning C_D008094 therapy and at biannual follow-up. RESULTS: D_D007037 developed in 40 patients, excluding 8 patients who were D_D007037 at baseline. All patients having first-degree relatives affected by D_D013959 had accelerated onset of D_D007037ism (3.7 years after onset of C_D008094 therapy) compared with patients without a family history (8.6 years after onset of C_D008094 therapy). Women over 60 years of age were more often affected by D_D007037ism than women under 60 years of age (34.6% versus 31.9%). C_D008274 levels in patients on C_D008094 treatment were unchanged from baseline levels. After C_D008094 treatment, C_D002118 levels were higher than either baseline levels or control levels. Thus, C_D008094 treatment counteracted the decrease in plasma C_D002118 levels associated with aging. CONCLUSIONS: Familial D_D013959 is a risk factor for D_D007037ism and D_D006934 during C_D008094 therapy.

title:Systemic D_D064420 following administration of C_D020123 (formerly C_D020123) for D_D011565: association of D_D019559 with apoptosis of lesional lymphocytes.
abstract:BACKGROUND: C_D020123 (formerly C_D020123) is an immunosuppressive agent that interferes with T-cell activation. After 2 individuals with D_D011565 developed a D_D019559 following treatment with oral C_D020123 lesional skin cells and activated peripheral blood cells were analyzed for induction of apoptosis. OBSERVATIONS: A keratome skin specimen from 1 patient with C_D020123-induced D_D019559 had a 2.3-fold increase in percentage of apoptotic cells (to 48%) compared with an unaffected C_D020123-treated patient with D_D011565 (21%). Activated peripheral blood T cells from patients with D_D011565 tended to exhibit greater spontaneous or C_D003907-induced apoptosis than did normal T cells, particularly in the presence of C_D020123. CONCLUSIONS: Severe adverse effects of C_D020123 include D_D005334, D_D000740, and D_D019559. These symptoms may be the result of drug-induced apoptosis of lesional leukocytes, especially activated T lymphocytes, and possibly release of inflammatory mediators. Because patients with severe D_D011565 may develop D_D019559 from various systemic therapies, clinical monitoring is advisable for patients with D_D007249 who are treated with immune modulators.

title:Contribution of the C_D005998 site of C_D016202 receptors in rostral and intermediate-caudal parts of the striatum to the regulation of muscle tone in rats.
abstract:The aim of the present study was to assess the contribution of the C_D005998 site of C_D016202 receptors in the striatum to the regulation of muscle tone. Muscle tone was examined using a combined mechanoand electromyographic method, which measured simultaneously the muscle resistance (MMG) of the rat's hind foot to passive extension and flexion in the ankle joint and the electromyographic activity (EMG) of the antagonistic muscles of that joint: gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior. D_D009127 was induced by C_D006220 (2.5 mg/kg i.p.). C_C066192 (C_C066192), a selective C_D005998 site antagonist, injected in doses of 2.5 and 4.5 microg/0.5 microl bilaterally, into the rostral region of the striatum, decreased both the C_D006220-induced D_D009127 (MMG) and the enhanced electromyographic activity (EMG). C_C066192 injected bilaterally in a dose of 4.5 microg/0.5 microl into the intermediate-caudal region of the striatum of rats not pretreated with C_D006220 had no effect on the muscle tone. The present results suggest that blockade of the C_D005998 site of C_D016202 receptors in the rostral part of the striatum may be mainly responsible for the antiparkinsonian action of this drug.

abstract:OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of C_D008148 in women with moderate D_D006937. DESIGN: The Expanded Clinical Evaluation of C_D008148 (EXCEL) Study, a multicenter, double-blind, diet- and placebo-controlled trial, in which participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo or C_D008148 at doses of 20 or 40 mg once daily, or 20 or 40 mg twice daily for 48 weeks. SETTING: Ambulatory patients recruited by 362 participating centers throughout the United States. PATIENTS: Women (n = 3390) from the total cohort of 8245 volunteers. MEASUREMENTS: Plasma total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) C_D002784, and C_D014280; and laboratory and clinical evidence of adverse events monitored periodically throughout the study. RESULTS: Among women, C_D008148 (20 to 80 mg/d) produced sustained (12- to 48-week), dose-related changes (P < 0.001): decreases in LDL C_D002784 (24% to 40%) and C_D014280 (9% to 18%), and increases in HDL C_D002784 (6.7% to 8.6%). Depending on the dose, from 82% to 95% of C_D008148-treated women achieved the National C_D002784 Education Program goal of LDL C_D002784 levels less than 4.14 mmol/L (160 mg/dL), and 40% to 87% achieved the goal of 3.36 mmol/L (130 mg/dL). Successive transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal occurred in 0.1% of women and were dose dependent above the 20-mg dose. D_D009135, defined as muscle symptoms with C_D003401 kinase elevations greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal, was rare and associated with the highest recommended daily dose of C_D008148 (80 mg). Estrogen-replacement therapy appeared to have no effect on either the efficacy or safety profile of C_D008148. CONCLUSION: C_D008148 is highly effective and generally well tolerated as therapy for primary D_D006937 in women.

title:Extrapyramidal side effects and oral C_D006220: an analysis of explanatory patient and treatment characteristics.
abstract:The incidence of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) was evaluated in 98 patients treated with C_D006220. The incidence of D_D010302 was higher at higher doses of C_D006220 and in younger patients. Prophylactic antiparkinsonian medication was effective in younger but not in older patients. However, these medications were more effective in both young and old patients when given after D_D010302 developed. D_D017109 was controlled by the C_D001569 C_D008140 in 14 out of 16 patients, while prophylactic antiparkinsonians were ineffective. The present study points to patient characteristics that may be of significance in the development of EPS due to C_D006220.

title:Treatment of C_D007069-induced D_D001745 by oral administration of C_D015080 (C_D015080) to patients with inoperable D_D008175.
abstract:The protective effect of oral administration of the C_D013438 compound C_D015080 (C_D015080) against D_D001745 induced by C_D007069 (C_D007069) was tested in a group of 45 patients with inoperable D_D008175 under treatment with C_D007069 (2250 mg/m2 on days 2-5) as part of a polychemotherapy regimen repeated in a 4-week cycle. C_D015080 was given orally on the days of treatment with C_D007069 in 3 doses of 840 mg/m2, each administered at 0 hr (= injection of C_D007069), 4 hr and 8 hr p.i. Out of a total of 88 courses of this treatment we observed 10 episodes of asymptomatic microscopic D_D006417 and no episodes of gross D_D006417. In this group of 45 patients under protection with C_D015080 there were 5 complete remissions and 9 partial remissions (total 31%). A further group of 25 patients under polychemotherapy with C_D007069 were treated by conventional prophylactic measures (raised fluid intake and forced diuresis). In this group there were 1 complete and 5 partial remissions (total 24%), but nearly all patients developed either gross D_D006417 and/or symptoms of D_D001745 (D_D003556 and D_D014555). There were no appreciable differences between the C_D015080 series and the conventional prophylaxis series with respect to either haematological or systemic D_D064420 of the cytostatic treatment. Our results support the view that C_D015080, given orally in conjunction with combined cytostatic regimens which include C_D007069, simplifies the treatment and provides optimum protection for the urinary epithelium. Protection with oral C_D015080 is particularly suitable for outpatients.

title:Production of autochthonous D_D011471 in Lobund-Wistar rats by treatments with C_D008770 and C_D013739.
abstract:More than 50% of Lobund-Wistar (L-W) strain rats developed large, palpable D_D011471 (D_D011471) following treatments with C_D008770 (CAS: 684-93-5) and C_D013739 propionate [(C_D043343) CAS: 57-85-2], and most of the D_D009369-bearing rats manifested metastatic lesions. The incubation periods averaged 10.6 months. Within the same timeframe, no L-W rat developed a similar palpable D_D011471 when treated only with C_D043343. In L-W rats, C_D043343 acted as a D_D009369 enhancement agent, with primary emphasis on the development of D_D011471.

title:A D_D004421-like syndrome after neuropeptide (C_D009074/C_D000324) stimulation of the rat locus ceruleus.
abstract:The D_D009069 investigated in these studies has some features in common with human idiopathic D_D004421, and information obtained in these studies may be of potential clinical benefit. The present experimental results indicated that peptidergic stimulation of the LC resulted in a NE-mediated inhibition of cerebellar Purkinje cells located at terminals of the ceruleo-cerebellar pathway. However, it is not certain as to the following: (a) what receptors were stimulated by the C_D000324 N-terminal fragments at the LC that resulted in this disorder; (b) whether NE, released onto Purkinje cell synapses located at terminals of the ceruleo-cerebellar pathway, did indeed cause the long-term D_D003866 at Purkinje cell synapses (previously described by others) that resulted in the long duration of the D_D009069; (c) whether the inhibition of inhibitory Purkinje cells resulted in disinhibition or increased excitability of the unilateral cerebellar fastigial or interpositus nuclei, the output targets of the Purkinje cell axons, that may have been an important contributing factor to this disorder. These questions are currently being investigated.

title:C_D020927, acting through central alpha-2 adrenoceptors, prevents opiate-induced D_D009127 in the rat.
abstract:The highly-selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist C_D020927 (C_D020927) is capable of inducing D_D009123 and anesthesia in rats and dogs. Intense generalized D_D009127 is an undesirable side effect of potent opiate agonists. Although the neurochemistry of opiate-induced D_D009127 has yet to be fully elucidated, recent work suggests a role for a central adrenergic mechanism. In the present study, the authors determined if treatment with C_D020927 prevents the D_D009127 caused by high-dose C_D015760 anesthesia in the rat. Animals (n = 42) were treated intraperitoneally with one of the following six regimens: 1) L-MED (the inactive L-isomer of C_D020926), 30 micrograms/kg; 2) C_D020927, 10 micrograms/kg; 3) C_D020927, 30 micrograms/kg; 4) C_D020927 [30 micrograms/kg] and the central-acting alpha-2 antagonist, C_D019329 [10 mg/kg]; 5) C_D020927 [30 micrograms/kg] and the peripheral-acting alpha-2 antagonist C_C032368 [10 mg/kg], or; 6) saline. Baseline electromyographic activity was recorded from the gastrocnemius muscle before and after drug treatment. Each rat was then injected with C_D015760 (C_D015760, 0.5 mg/kg sc). C_D015760 injection resulted in a marked increase in hindlimb EMG activity in the L-MED treatment group which was indistinguishable from that seen in animals treated with saline. In contrast, C_D020927 prevented C_D015760-induced D_D009127 in a dose-dependent fashion. The small EMG values obtained in the high-dose C_D020927 group were comparable with those recorded in earlier studies from control animals not given any opiate. The high-dose C_D020927 animals were flaccid, D_D018476, and lacked a D_D012021 response during the entire experimental period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

title:D_D012640 activity with C_D015378 therapy: incidence and risk factors.
abstract:Two elderly patients with a history of either D_D020521 (D_D020521) or D_D006259 and no evidence of D_D007674 developed D_D012640 while receiving maximum doses of C_D015378/cilastatin. Neither patient had reported previous D_D012640 or D_D012640-like activity nor was receiving anticonvulsant agents. All D_D012640 were controlled with therapeutic doses of C_D010672. Both patients had received maximum doses of other C_D047090 antibiotics without evidence of D_D012640 activity.

title:The ability of insulin treatment to reverse or prevent the changes in urinary bladder function caused by C_D013311-induced D_D003920.
abstract:1. The effects of insulin treatment on in vivo and in vitro urinary bladder function in C_D013311-D_D003920 rats were investigated. 2. D_D003920 of 2 months duration resulted in decreases in body weight and increases in fluid consumption, urine volume, frequency of micturition, and average volume per micturition; effects which were prevented by insulin treatment. 3. Insulin treatment also prevented the increases in contractile responses of bladder body strips from D_D003920 rats to nerve stimulation, C_D000255, and C_D018723. 4. D_D003920 of 4 months duration also resulted in decreases in body weight, and increases in fluid consumption, urine volume, frequency of micturition, and average volume per micturition, effects which were reversed by insulin treatment for the final 2 months of the study. 5. Insulin treatment reversed the increases in contractile responses of bladder body strips from D_D003920 rats to nerve stimulation, C_D000255, and C_D018723. 6. The data indicate that the effects of C_D013311-induced D_D003920 on urinary bladder function are both prevented and reversed by insulin treatment.

title:Delayed institution of D_D006973 during focal D_D002545: effect on D_D001929.
abstract:The effect of induced D_D006973 instituted after a 2-h delay following D_D020244 (D_D020244) on D_D001929 formation and histochemical injury was studied. Under C_D007530 anesthesia, the MCA of 14 spontaneously D_D006973 rats was occluded. In the control group (n = 7), the mean arterial pressure (MAP) was not manipulated. In the D_D006973 group (n = 7), the MAP was elevated by 25-30 mm Hg beginning 2 h after D_D020244. Four hours after D_D020244, the rats were killed and the brains harvested. The brains were sectioned along coronal planes spanning the distribution of D_D007511 produced by D_D020244. Specific gravity (SG) was determined in the subcortex and in two sites in the cortex (core and periphery of the D_D007511 territory). The extent of D_D009410 was determined by C_C009591 staining. In the D_D007511 core, there was no difference in SG in the subcortex and cortex in the two groups. In the periphery of the D_D007511 territory, SG in the cortex was greater (less D_D004487 accumulation) in the D_D006973 group (1.041 +/- 0.001 vs 1.039 +/- 0.001, P less than 0.05). The area of histochemical injury (as a percent of the cross-sectional area of the hemisphere) was less in the D_D006973 group (33 +/- 3% vs 21 +/- 2%, P less than 0.05). The data indicate that C_D010656-induced D_D006973 instituted 2 h after D_D020244 does not aggravate D_D004487 in the D_D007511 core, that it improves D_D004487 in the periphery of the D_D007511 territory, and that it reduces the area of histochemical D_D009410.

title:C_D000638 D_D008171.
abstract:C_D000638 is an effective antiarrhythmic agent whose utility is limited by many side-effects, the most problematic being D_D011014. The D_D008171 of C_D000638 is thought to result from direct injury related to the intracellular accumulation of phospholipid and T cell-mediated hypersensitivity D_D011014. The clinical and radiographic features of C_D000638-induced D_D008171 are characteristic but nonspecific. The diagnosis depends on exclusion of other entities, such as D_D006333, D_D007239, and D_D009369. While withdrawal of C_D000638 leads to clinical improvement in majority of cases, this is not always possible or advisable. Dose reduction or concomitant C_D013256 therapy may have a role in selected patients.

title:Light chain D_D011507 and cellular mediated immunity in C_D012293 treated patients with D_D014376.
abstract:Light chain D_D011507 was found in 9 of 17 D_D014376 patients treated with C_D012293. Concomitant assay of cellular mediated immunity in these patients using skin test antigen and a lymphokine in vitro test provided results that were different. Response to Varidase skin test antigen was negative for all eight D_D014376 patients tested, but there occurred a hyper-responsiveness of the lymphocytes of these eight patients to phytomitogen (PHA-P). as well as of those of seven other D_D014376 patients. This last finding may be related to time of testing and/or endogenous serum binding of C_D012293 which could have inhibited mitogen activity for the lymphocyte.

title:Initial C_D011188 loss and D_D007008 during C_D002752 administration in patients with essential D_D006973: the influence of dietary C_D012964 restriction.
abstract:To investigate the initial C_D011188 loss and development of D_D007008 during the administration of an oral diuretic, metabolic balance studies were performed in ten patients with essential D_D006973 who had shown D_D007008 under prior oral diuretic treatment. C_D002752 (50 mg daily) was given for 14 days. Six patients received a normal-C_D012964 diet and four a low-C_D012964 (17 mmol/day) diet. All patients had a normal initial total body C_D011188 (40K). The electrolyte balances, weight, bromide space, plasma renin activity, and C_D000450 secretion rate were measured. In both groups a C_D011188 deficit developed, with proportionally larger losses from the extracellular than from the intracellular compartment. In the normal-C_D012964 group the highest mean C_D011188 deficit was 176 mmol on day 9, after which some C_D011188 was regained; in the low-C_D012964 group the highest deficit was 276 mmol on day 13. The normal-C_D012964 group showed an immediate but temporary rise of the renin and C_D000450 levels; in the low-C_D012964 group renin and C_D000450 increased more slowly but remained elevated. It is concluded that dietary C_D012964 restriction increases diuretic-induced C_D011188 loss, presumably by an increased activity of the renin-C_D000809-C_D000450 system, while C_D012964 delivery to the distal renal tubules remains sufficiently high to allow increased C_D011188 secretion.

title:Dynamic response of blood vessel in D_D058186.
abstract:In this study we postulated that during D_D058186 induced by C_D005839 the transient or dynamic response of blood vessels could be affected, and that antioxidants can prevent the changes in dynamic responses of blood vessels. The new approach to ex vivo blood vessel experiments in which not only the end points of vessels response within the time interval is considered, but also dynamics of this response, was used in this paper. Our results confirm the alteration in dynamic response of blood vessels during the change of pressure in C_D005839-treated animals. The beneficial effects of C_D001205 administration to C_D005839-treated animals are also confirmed through: lower level of blood C_D014508 and C_D003404 and higher level of C_D011188. The pressure dynamic responses of isolated blood vessels show a faster pressure change in C_D005839-treated animals (8.07 +/- 1.7 s vs. 5.64 +/- 0.18 s). C_D001205 administration induced slowdown of pressure change back to the control values. The pressure dynamic properties, quantitatively defined by comparative pressure dynamic and total pressure dynamic, confirm the alteration in dynamic response of blood vessels during the change of pressure in C_D005839-treated animals and beneficial effects of C_D001205 administration.

title:The hemodynamics of C_D010121 and other vasoactive agents during neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery: findings in six cases.
abstract:C_D010121 is a commonly used uterotonic that can cause significant and even fatal D_D007022, particularly when given as a bolus. The resulting D_D007022 can be produced by a decrease in systemic vascular resistance or cardiac output through a decrease in venous return. Parturients with normal volume status, heart valves and pulmonary vasculature most often respond to this D_D007022 with a compensatory increase in heart rate and D_D020521 volume. C_D010121-induced D_D007022 at cesarean delivery may be incorrectly attributed to D_D006473. Pulse power analysis (also called "pulse contour analysis") of an arterial pressure wave form allows continuous evaluation of systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output in real time, thereby elucidating the causative factors behind changes in blood pressure. Pulse power analysis was conducted in six cases of cesarean delivery performed under neuraxial anesthesia. D_D007022 in response to C_D010121 was associated with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and a compensatory increase in D_D020521 volume, heart rate and cardiac output. Pulse power analysis may be helpful in determining the etiology of and treating D_D007022 during cesarean delivery under neuraxial anesthesia.

title:Exaggerated expression of inflammatory mediators in vasoactive intestinal polypeptide knockout (VIP-/-) mice with C_D003520 (C_D003520)-induced D_D003556.
abstract:Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) is an immunomodulatory neuropeptide distributed in micturition pathways. VIP(-/-) mice exhibit altered bladder function and neurochemical properties in micturition pathways after C_D003520 (C_D003520)-induced D_D003556. Given VIP's role as an anti-inflammatory mediator, we hypothesized that VIP(-/-) mice would exhibit enhanced inflammatory mediator expression after D_D003556. A mouse inflammatory cytokine and receptor RT2 profiler array was used to determine regulated transcripts in the urinary bladder of wild type (WT) and VIP(-/-) mice with or without C_D003520-induced D_D003556 (150 mg/kg; i.p.; 48 h). Four binary comparisons were made: WT control versus C_D003520 treatment (48 h), VIP(-/-) control versus C_D003520 treatment (48 h), WT control versus VIP(-/-) control, and WT with C_D003520 treatment (48 h) versus VIP(-/-) with C_D003520 treatment (48 h). The genes presented represent (1) greater than 1.5-fold change in either direction and (2) the p value is less than 0.05 for the comparison being made. Several regulated genes were validated using enzyme-linked immunoassays including IL-1beta and CXCL1. C_D003520 treatment significantly (p < or = 0.001) increased expression of CXCL1 and IL-1beta in the urinary bladder of WT and VIP(-/-) mice, but expression in VIP(-/-) mice with C_D003520 treatment was significantly (p < or = 0.001) greater (4.2- to 13-fold increase) than that observed in WT urinary bladder (3.6- to 5-fold increase). The data suggest that in VIP(-/-) mice with D_D001745, inflammatory mediators are increased above that observed in WT with C_D003520. This shift in balance may contribute to increased D_D001745 in VIP(-/-) mice with D_D001745 and altered neurochemical expression in micturition pathways.

title:Intraocular pressure in patients with D_D014605 treated with C_D005446 implants.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: To report the incidence and management of D_D009798 (IOP) in patients with D_D014605 treated with the C_D005446 (C_D005446) intravitreal implant. DESIGN: Pooled data from 3 multicenter, double-masked, randomized, controlled, phase 2b/3 clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of the 0.59-mg or 2.1-mg C_D005446 intravitreal implant or standard therapy were analyzed. RESULTS: During the 3-year follow-up, 71.0% of implanted eyes had an IOP increase of 10 mm Hg or more than baseline and 55.1%, 24.7%, and 6.2% of eyes reached an IOP of 30 mm Hg or more, 40 mm Hg or more, and 50 mm Hg or more, respectively. Topical IOP-lowering medication was administered in 74.8% of implanted eyes, and IOP-lowering surgeries, most of which were trabeculectomies (76.2%), were performed on 36.6% of implanted eyes. Intraocular pressure-lowering surgeries were considered a success (postoperative IOP of 6-21 mm Hg with or without additional IOP-lowering medication) in 85.1% of eyes at 1 year. The rate of D_D015814 (IOP </= 5 mm Hg) following IOP-lowering surgery (42.5%) was not different from that of implanted eyes not subjected to surgery (35.4%) (P = .09). CONCLUSION: Elevated IOP is a significant complication with the C_D005446 intravitreal implant but may be controlled with medication and surgery.

title:Pallidal stimulation: an alternative to pallidotomy?
abstract:A resurgence of interest in the surgical treatment of D_D010300 (D_D010300) came with the rediscovery of posteroventral pallidotomy by Laitinen in 1985. Laitinen's procedure improved most symptoms in drug-resistant D_D010300, which engendered wide interest in the neurosurgical community. Another lesioning procedure, ventrolateral thalamotomy, has become a powerful alternative to stimulate the nucleus ventralis intermedius, producing high long-term success rates and low morbidity rates. Pallidal stimulation has not met with the same success. According to the literature pallidotomy improves the "on" symptoms of D_D010300, such as D_D004409, as well as the "off" symptoms, such as D_D009127, D_D018476, and on-off fluctuations. Pallidal stimulation improves D_D018476 and D_D009127 to a minor extent; however, its strength seems to be in improving C_D007980-induced D_D004409. Stimulation often produces an improvement in the D_D006948|D004409 upper limbs, but increases the "freezing" phenomenon in the lower limbs at the same time. Considering the small increase in the patient's independence, the high costs of bilateral implants, and the difficulty most patients experience in handling the devices, the question arises as to whether bilateral pallidal stimulation is a real alternative to pallidotomy.

title:Case report: C_D010665 (C_D010665) as a cause of D_D009203.
abstract:C_D010665 (C_D010665) is a sympathetic C_D000588 used in over-the-counter cold remedies and weight-control preparations worldwide. Its use has been associated with D_D006973 episodes and hemorrhagic strokes in younger women. Several reports have linked the abuse of C_D010665 with D_D009202, especially when D_D062787 is involved. We report here the first case of C_D010665 (C_D010665)-induced D_D009202 in a young woman who was using it at recommended doses for weight control. In addition, we review the 7 other cases of C_D010665 related D_D009202 that have been reported so far. Physicians and patients should be alert to the potential cardiac risk associated with the use of C_D010665, even at doses generally considered to be safe.

title:C_D018967-associated, benign transient D_D010468 in D_D012559 patients with a past history of C_D008238 abuse.
abstract:Two D_D012559 patients, who had a prior history of C_D008238 abuse and who had previously developed D_D001480 with classic antipsychotics, were successfully treated with C_D018967. They both reported short episodes of transient D_D010468, which appeared immediately after starting treatment with C_D018967. This imagery resembled D_D010468 previously experienced as "flashbacks" related to prior C_D008238 consumption. C_D018967 administration was continued and the D_D010468 gradually wore off. During a six-month follow-up period, there was no recurrence of D_D010468. This phenomenon may be interpreted as a benign, short-term and self-limiting side effect which does not contraindicate the use of C_D018967 or interfere with treatment. Conclusions based on two case reports should be taken with appropriate caution.

title:Activation of C_D011064 polymerase contributes to development of C_D004317-induced D_D006333.
abstract:Activation of the nuclear enzyme C_D011064 polymerase (PARP) by oxidant-mediated DNA damage is an important pathway of cell dysfunction and tissue injury in conditions associated with oxidative stress. Increased oxidative stress is a major factor implicated in the D_D066126 of C_D004317 (C_D004317), a widely used antitumor C_D018943 antibiotic. Thus, we hypothesized that the activation of PARP may contribute to the C_D004317-induced D_D066126. Using a dual approach of PARP-1 suppression, by genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition with the phenanthridinone PARP inhibitor C_C434926, we now demonstrate the role of PARP in the development of D_D006331 induced by C_D004317. PARP-1+/+ and PARP-1-/- mice received a single injection of C_D004317 (25 mg/kg i.p). Five days after C_D004317 administration, left ventricular performance was significantly depressed in PARP-1+/+ mice, but only to a smaller extent in PARP-1-/- ones. Similar experiments were conducted in BALB/c mice treated with C_C434926 or vehicle. Treatment with a C_C434926 significantly improved D_D006331 and increased the survival of the animals. In addition C_C434926 significantly reduced the C_D004317-induced increase in the serum C_D019344 dehydrogenase and C_D003401 kinase activities but not metalloproteinase activation in the heart. Thus, PARP activation contributes to the D_D066126 of C_D004317. PARP inhibitors may exert protective effects against the development of severe D_D005117 associated with the C_D004317 treatment.

title:C_D015725-induced D_D016171.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: To present a case of C_D015725-associated D_D016171 (D_D016171) and discuss C_D015725's role in causing D_D016171. CASE SUMMARY: A 68-year-old white woman with Candida glabrata isolated from a presacral abscess developed D_D016171 eight days after commencing oral C_D015725 The patient had no other risk factors for D_D016171, including D_D003324, D_D009202, D_D006333, and electrolyte abnormalities There was a temporal association between the initiation of C_D015725 and D_D016171. The D_D016171 resolved when C_D015725 was discontinued; however, the patient continued to have D_D018879 and nonsustained D_D017180 (D_D017180) until six days after drug cessation DISCUSSION: Use of the Naranjo probability scale indicates a probable relationship between the use of C_D015725 and the development of D_D016171. The possible mechanism is D_D003866 of rapidly activating delayed rectifier C_D011188 currents. In our patient, there was no other etiology identified that could explain D_D008133 or D_D016171 The complete disappearance of D_D017180 and D_D018879 followed by normalization of QT interval after the drug was stopped strongly suggests C_D015725 as the etiology. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware that C_D015725, even at low doses, may cause D_D008133, leading to D_D016171. Serial electrocardiographic monitoring may be considered when C_D015725 is administered in patients who are at risk for D_D001145.

title:High-dose C_D008775 may do more harm for D_D013119.
abstract:Because of the National Acute D_D013119 Studies (NASCIS), high-dose C_D008775 became the standard of care for the acute D_D013119. In the NASCIS, there was no mention regarding the possibility of acute C_D000305 D_D009135 that high-dose C_D008775 may cause. The dosage of C_D008775 recommended by the NASCIS 3 is the highest dose of C_D013256 ever being used during a 2-day period for any clinical condition. We hypothesize that it may cause some D_D009135 of D_D013119 patients. Further, C_D013256 D_D009135 recovers naturally and the neurological improvement shown in the NASCIS may be just a recording of this natural motor recovery from the C_D013256 D_D009135, instead of any protection that C_D008775 offers to the D_D013119. To our knowledge, this is the first discussion considering the possibility that the C_D008775 recommended by NASCIS may cause acute C_D000305 D_D009135.

title:Probing peripheral and central cholinergic system responses.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: The pharmacological response to drugs that act on the cholinergic system of the iris has been used to predict deficits in central cholinergic functioning due to diseases such as D_D000544, yet correlations between central and peripheral responses have not been properly studied. This study assessed the effect of normal aging on (1) the C_D014331-induced increase in pupil diameter, and (2) the reversal of this effect with C_D010862. C_D012601 was used as a positive control to detect age-dependent changes in central cholinergic functioning in the elderly. DESIGN: Randomized double-blind controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Ten healthy elderly (mean age 70) and 9 young (mean age 33) volunteers. INTERVENTIONS: Pupil diameter was monitored using a computerized infrared pupillometer over 4 hours. The study involved 4 sessions. In 1 session, C_D014331 (20 microL, 0.01%) was administered to one eye and placebo to the other. In another session, C_D014331 (20 microL, 0.01%) was administered to both eyes, followed 23 minutes later by the application of C_D010862 (20 microL, 0.1%) to one eye and placebo to the other. All eye drops were given in a randomized order. In 2 separate sessions, a single dose of C_D012601 (0.5 mg, intravenously) or placebo was administered, and the effects on word recall were measured using the Buschke Selective Reminding Test over 2 hours. OUTCOME MEASURES: Pupil size at time points after administration of C_D014331 and C_D010862; C_D012601-induced D_D008569. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between elderly and young volunteers in pupillary response to C_D014331 at any time point (p > 0.05). The elderly group had a significantly greater C_D010862-induced net decrease in pupil size 85, 125, 165 and 215 minutes after administration, compared with the young group (p < 0.05). Compared with the young group, the elderly group had greater C_D012601-induced D_D008569 60, 90 and 120 minutes after administration (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: There is an age-related pupillary response to C_D010862 that is not found with C_D014331. Thus, C_D010862 may be useful to assess variations in central cholinergic function in elderly patients.

title:Neutrophil C_D013481 and C_D006861 production in patients with D_D017114.
abstract:Defects in C_D013481 and C_D006861 production may be implicated in the high incidence of D_D001424 in patients with D_D017114 (D_D017114). In the present study, C_D010100 radical production in patients with D_D017114 due to C_D000082 D_D062787 was compared with that of healthy volunteers. Neutrophils from 14 D_D017114 patients were stimulated via the complement receptors using zymosan opsonized with D_D017114 or control serum. C_D013481 and C_D006861 production by D_D017114 neutrophils stimulated with zymosan opsonized with D_D017114 serum was significantly reduced compared with the control subjects (P < 0.01). This defect persisted when zymosan opsonized by control serum was used (P < 0.05). C_D013481 and C_D006861 production in neutrophils stimulated with C_D009240 (C_D009240) from a further 18 D_D017114 patients was unaffected compared with control neutrophils. Serum C3 complement levels were significantly reduced in D_D017114 patients compared with control subjects (P < 0.0005). These results demonstrate a neutrophil defect in D_D017114 due to C_D000082 D_D062787, that is complement dependent but independent of serum complement, possibly connected to the complement receptor.

title:Absence of effect of C_D020280 on time-based sensitization of D_D003072 with C_D006220.
abstract:This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluated the effects of C_D006220 alone and C_D006220 plus C_D020280 on cognitive and psychomotor function in 24 healthy male subjects. METHOD: All subjects received placebo on Day 1 and C_D006220 2 mg on Days 2 and 25. From Days 9 to 25, subjects were randomly assigned to either C_D020280 (12 subjects) or placebo (12 subjects); the C_D020280 dose was titrated from 50 to 200 mg/day from Days 9 to 16, and remained at 200 mg/day for the final 10 days of the drug administration period. Cognitive function testing was performed before dosing and over a 24-hour period after dosing on Days 1, 2, and 25. RESULTS: D_D003072 was observed 6 to 8 hours after administration of C_D006220 on Day 2 but was not evident 23 hours after dosing. When single-dose C_D006220 was given again 25 days later, greater impairment with earlier onset was noted in several tests in both treatment groups, suggesting enhancement of this effect. There was no indication that C_D020280 exacerbated the impairment produced by C_D006220 since an equivalent effect also occurred in the placebo group. Three subjects (2 on C_D020280 and 1 on placebo) withdrew from the study because of side effects. Ten subjects in each group reported side effects related to treatment. The side effect profiles of C_D020280 and of placebo were similar. CONCLUSION: C_D006220 produced a clear profile of D_D003072 that was not worsened by concomitant C_D020280 administration.

title:C_D002939-induced D_D007674 in patients with D_D009369.
abstract:D_D007674 associated with C_D002939 is uncommon. Five patients with D_D009369 who developed D_D058186 that followed treatment with C_D002939 are described and an additional 15 cases reported in the literature are reviewed. Other than elevation of serum C_D003404 levels, characteristic clinical manifestations and abnormal laboratory findings are not frequently present. Allergic D_D009395 is believed to be the underlying pathological-process. Definitive diagnosis requires performance of renal biopsy, although this is not always feasible. An improvement in renal function that followed the discontinuation of the offending antibiotic supports the presumptive diagnosis of C_D002939-induced D_D058186.

abstract:C_D010419 has been associated with D_D017180, including D_D016171. This article reports two cases of this complication and reviews all reported cases to date. C_D010419-induced D_D016171 may be related to serum C_D008274 levels and D_C537153 may synergistically induce torsade. D_D016171 occurred after an average of 10 days of treatment with C_D010419. In these patients, no other acute side effects of C_D010419 were observed. D_D016171 can be treated when recognized early, possibly without discontinuation of C_D010419. When D_D008133 is observed, early C_D008274 supplementation is advocated.

title:Time dependence of plasma C_D008315, C_-1, and C_D009705 during incomplete D_D002545 in the rat.
abstract:Incomplete D_D002545 (30 min) was induced in the rat by bilaterally clamping the common carotid arteries. Peripheral venous blood samples were withdrawn from the femoral vein four times (once every 5 min) before D_D007511 (0 time) and 5, 15, and 30 min after D_D007511. Plasma extracts were analyzed by a highly sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the direct determination of C_D008315, C_-1, and C_D009705. During D_D007511, a time-dependent increase of plasma C_-1 and C_D009705 was observed. Plasma C_D008315, which was present in minimal amount at zero time (0.058 mumol/liter plasma; SD 0.015), increased after 5 min of D_D007511, resulting in a fivefold increase after 30 min of carotid occlusion (0.298 mumol/liter plasma; SD 0.078). Increased plasma C_D008315 was also recorded in two other groups of animals subjected to the same experimental model, one receiving 20 mg/kg b.w. of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor C_D001241 intravenously immediately before D_D007511, the other receiving 650 micrograms/kg b.w. of the D_D007022 drug C_D009599 at a flow rate of 103 microliters/min intravenously during D_D007511, although in this latter group C_D008315 was significantly higher. The present data indicate that the determination of C_D008315, C_-1, and C_D009705 in peripheral blood, may be used to monitor the metabolic alterations of tissues occurring during D_D007511 phenomena.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

title:Induction of the D_D020181 in a woman by exogenous C_D000728 administration.
abstract:We documented airway occlusion during sleep and an abnormally high supraglottic resistance while awake in a 54-yr-old woman who had developed physical changes and the D_D020181 while being administered exogenous C_D000728s. When the C_D000728s were withdrawn, the patient's physical changes, symptoms, sleep study, and supraglottic resistance all returned to normal. A rechallenge with C_D000728 produced symptoms of D_D020181 that abated upon withdrawal of the hormone. Previous reports have favored a role of C_D000728s in the pathogenesis of D_D012891. Our report provides direct evidence for this role. Structural and functional measurements indicate that C_D000728s exert a permissive or necessary action on the structural configuration of the oropharynx that predisposes to obstruction during sleep. Development of the D_D020181 must be considered a possible side effect of C_D000728 therapy.

abstract:D_D011507 is a side effect of C_D002216 treatment in D_D006973 patients. The possibility of reproducing the same D_D007674 with C_D002216 was examined in SHR. Oral administration of C_D002216 at 100 mg/kg for 14 days failed to aggravate D_D011507 pre-existing in SHR. Also, C_D002216 treatment failed to potentiate or facilitate development of massive D_D011507 invoked by puromycin C_D011692 in SHR. C_D002216 had little or no demonstrable effects on serum electrolyte concentrations, excretion of urine, C_D012964 and C_D011188, endogenous C_D003404 clearance, body weight, and food and water consumption. However, C_D007659 bodies were consistently present in urine and several lethalities occurred during multiple dosing of C_D002216 in SHR.

title:Epileptogenic properties of C_D004737 and their clinical interpretation.
abstract:Three cases of EEG changes induced by single exposure to C_D004737 anesthesia are reported. In one patient, C_D004737 administered during a donor nephrectomy resulted in unexpected partial motor D_D012640. Until the cause of the D_D012640 was correctly identified, the patient was inappropriately treated with anticonvulsants. Two other patients suffered from partial, complex and generalized D_D012640 uncontrolled by medication. D_D004827 foci delineated and activated by C_D004737 were surgically ablated and the patients are now D_D012640-free. Previous exposures to C_D004737 have to be disclosed to avoid mistakes in clinical interpretation of the EEG. On the other hand, C_D004737 may prove to be a safe fast acting activator of D_D004827 foci during corticography or depth electrode intraoperative recordings.

title:Antagonism of C_D003975-induced sedative effects by C_D005442 in patients after surgery under lumbar epidural block. A double-blind placebo-controlled investigation of efficacy and safety.
abstract:The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of C_D005442 and a placebo in reversing C_D003975-induced effects after surgery under epidural block, and to evaluate the local tolerance and general safety of C_D005442. Fifty-seven patients were sedated with C_D003975 for surgery under epidural anaesthesia. Antagonism of C_D003975-induced effects by C_D005442 was investigated postoperatively in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. The patient's subjective assessment of mood rating, an objective test of performance, a test for D_D000647, and vital signs were recorded for up to 300 min after administration of the trial drug. No significant differences between the two groups were observed for mood rating, D_D000647, or vital signs. The C_D005442 group showed a significant improvement in the performance test up to 120 min after administration of the drug. There was no evidence of reaction at the injection site.

title:Enhanced stimulus-induced neurotransmitter overflow in C_D004837-induced D_D006973 rats is not mediated by prejunctional beta-adrenoceptor activation.
abstract:The present study examines the effect of 6-day C_D004837 treatment (100 micrograms/kg per h, s.c.) on stimulus-induced (1 Hz) endogenous neurotransmitter overflow from the isolated perfused kidney of vehicle- and C_D004837-treated rats. Renal C_D002395 stores and stimulus-induced overflow in the vehicle-treated group consisted of norC_D004837 only. However, C_D004837 treatment resulted in the incorporation of C_D004837 into renal C_D002395 stores such that approximately 40% of the C_D002395 present was C_D004837 while the norC_D004837 content was reduced by a similar degree. Total tissue C_D002395 content of the kidney on a molar basis was unchanged. Stimulus-induced fractional overflow of neurotransmitter from the C_D004837-treated kidneys was approximately twice normal and consisted of both norC_D004837 and C_D004837 in proportions similar to those found in the kidney. This difference in fractional overflow between groups was not affected by neuronal and extraneuronal uptake blockade. C_D011433 had no effect on stimulus-induced overflow in either group. C_D010646 increased stimulus-induced overflow in both groups although the increment in overflow was greater in the C_D004837-treated group. In conclusion, chronic C_D004837 treatment results in enhanced fractional neurotransmitter overflow. However, neither alterations in prejunctional beta-adrenoceptor influences nor alterations in neuronal and extraneuronal uptake mechanisms appear to be responsible for this alteration. Furthermore, data obtained with C_D010646 alone do not suggest alpha-adrenoceptor desensitization as the cause of the enhanced neurotransmitter overflow after C_D004837 treatment.

title:Ocular manifestations of D_D001171.
abstract:We followed 210 cases of D_D001171 closely for eleven years. Thirty-six of the 210 patients (17.2%) developed D_D015863. D_D015863 was seen most frequently in young female patients (0 to 4 years) with the monoarticular or pauciatricular form of the D_D001168. However, 30% of the patients developed D_D014605 after 16 years of age. Although 61% of patients had a noncontributory ocular history on entry, 42% had active D_D014605 on entry. Our approach was effective in detecting D_D014605 in new cases and exacerbations of D_D014605 in established cases. Forty-four percent of patients with D_D014605 had one or more identifiable signs or symptoms, such as red eye, D_D058447, D_D014786, or D_D020795, in order of decreasing frequency. Even after early detection and prompt treatment, 41% of cases of D_D014605 did not respond to more than six months of intensive topical treatment with C_D000305 and mydriatics. Despite this, there was a dramatic decrease in the 50% incidence of blinding complications of D_D014605 cited in earlier studies. D_D002386 and D_C562399 occurred in only 22 and 13% of our group, respectively. We used C_D002738 or hydroxyC_D002738 in 173 of 210 cases and found only one case of D_D012164 attributable to these drugs. Systemically administered C_D000305 were used in 75 of 210 cases; a significant number of posterior subcapsular D_D002386 was found. Typical D_D007637 sicca developed in three of the D_D014605 cases. This association with D_D014605 and JRA was not noted previously. Surgical treatment of D_D002386, D_C562399, and D_D005901 achieved uniformly discouraging results.

abstract:Four cases of D_D014869 in connection with C_D010121 administration during saline-induced D_D000031s are described. The mechanism of D_D014869 is discussed in regard to these cases. C_D010121 administration during midtrimester-induced D_D000031s is advocated only if it can be carried out under careful observations of an alert nursing staff, aware of the symptoms of D_D014869 and instructed to watch the diuresis and report such early signs of the syndrome as D_D001247, muscular D_D001523, or D_D006261. The C_D010121 should be given only in Ringers C_D019344 or, alternately, in Ringers C_D019344 and a 5 per cent C_D005947 and water solutions. The urinary output should be monitored and the C_D010121 administration discontinued and the serum electrolytes checked if the urinary output decreases. The C_D010121 should not be administered in excess of 36 hours. If the patient has not aborted by then the C_D010121 should be discontinued for 10 to 12 hours in order to perform electrolyte determinations and correct any electrolyte imbalance.
