title:C_D009270 reverses the antiD_D006973 effect of C_D003000.
abstract:In unanesthetized, spontaneously D_D006973 rats the decrease in blood pressure and heart rate produced by intravenous C_D003000, 5 to 20 micrograms/kg, was inhibited or reversed by C_-1, 0.2 to 2 mg/kg. The D_D007022 effect of 100 mg/kg C_D008750 was also partially reversed by C_D009270. C_D009270 alone did not affect either blood pressure or heart rate. In brain membranes from spontaneously D_D006973 rats C_D003000, 10(-8) to 10(-5) M, did not influence stereoselective binding of [3H]-C_D009270 (8 nM), and C_D009270, 10(-8) to 10(-4) M, did not influence C_D003000-suppressible binding of C_-1 (1 nM). These findings indicate that in spontaneously D_D006973 rats the effects of central alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation involve activation of opiate receptors. As C_D009270 and C_D003000 do not appear to interact with the same receptor site, the observed functional antagonism suggests the release of an endogenous opiate by C_D003000 or C_D008750 and the possible role of the opiate in the central control of sympathetic tone.

title:C_D008012-induced D_D006323.
abstract:Intravenous administration of a single 50-mg bolus of C_D008012 in a 67-year-old man resulted in profound D_D003866 of the activity of the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodal pacemakers. The patient had no apparent associated conditions which might have predisposed him to the development of D_D001919; and, thus, this probably represented a true idiosyncrasy to C_D008012.

title:C_D013390 infusion rate and observed D_D005207. A dose-response study.
abstract:C_D013390 chloride (C_D013390) was administered i.v. to 36 adult males at six rates: 0.25 mg s-1 to 20 mg s-1. The infusion was discontinued either when there was no muscular response to D_D013746 stimulation of the ulnar nerve or when C_D013390 120 mg was exceeded. Six additional patients received a 30-mg i.v. bolus dose. D_D005207 in six areas of the body were scored from 0 to 3 and summated as a total D_D005207 score. The times to first D_D005207, D_D013746 suppression and D_D013746 suppression were inversely related to the infusion rates. D_D005207 in the six areas and the total D_D005207 score were related directly to the rate of infusion. Total D_D005207 scores in the 30-mg bolus group and the 5-mg s-1 and 20-mg s-1 infusion groups were not significantly different.

It is longer acting than C_D010830 and is used in anaesthesia to reverse the non-depolarizing neuromuscular block. However, studies into the dose necessary to combating C_D012601 intoxication are indicated.

title:Effects of uninephrectomy and high protein feeding on C_D008094-induced D_D007676 in rats.
abstract:Rats with C_D008094-induced D_D007674 were subjected to high protein (HP) feeding, uninephrectomy (NX) or a combination of these, in an attempt to induce glomerular hyperfiltration and further progression of D_D051437. Newborn female Wistar rats were fed a C_D008094-containing diet (50 mmol/kg) for 8 weeks and then randomized to normal diet, HP diet (40 vs. 19%), NX or HP+NX for another 8 weeks. Corresponding non-C_D008094 pretreated groups were generated. When comparing all C_D008094 treated versus non-C_D008094-treated groups, C_D008094 caused a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) without significant changes in effective renal plasma flow (as determined by a marker secreted into the proximal tubules) or C_D008094 clearance. Consequently, C_D008094 pretreatment caused a fall in filtration fraction and an increase in fractional C_D008094 excretion. C_D008094thium also caused D_D011507 and systolic D_D006973 in absence of D_D005921. HP failed to accentuante progression of D_D051437 and in fact tended to increase GFR and decrease plasma C_D003404 levels in C_D008094 pretreated rats. NX caused an additive deterioration in GFR which, however, was ameliorated by HP. NX+HP caused a further rise in blood pressure in C_D008094-pretreated rats. The results indicate that C_D008094-induced D_D007674, even when the GFR is only modestly reduced, is associated with D_D011507 and arterial systolic D_D006973. In this model of D_D007676 the decline in GFR is not accompanied by a corresponding fall in effective renal plasma flow, which may be the functional expression of the formation of nonfiltrating atubular glomeruli. The fractional reabsorption of tubular fluid by the proximal tubules is reduced, leaving the distal delivery unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

title:Treatment of D_D003424 with C_D005672: an antibiotic with immunosuppressive properties similar to C_D016572.
abstract:C_D005672 is an antibiotic with T-cell specific immunosuppressive effects similar to those of C_D016572. Because of the need for the development of new treatments for D_D003424, a pilot study was undertaken to estimate the pharmacodynamics and tolerability of C_D005672 treatment in chronic active, therapy-resistant patients. Eight D_D003424 patients were included. C_D005672 was administered orally in a dose of 500 mg t.d.s. and the treatment was planned to last 8 weeks. The disease activity was primarily measured by a modified individual grading score. Five of 8 patients (63%) improved during C_D005672 treatment: 3 at two weeks and 2 after four weeks. There were no serious clinical side effects, but dose reduction was required in two patients because of D_D009325. Biochemically, an increase in alkaline phosphatases was noted in 5 of 8 cases (63%), and the greatest increases were seen in those who had elevated levels prior to treatment. All reversed to pre-treatment levels after cessation of treatment. The results of this pilot study suggest that C_D005672 may be of benefit in selected chronic active D_D003424 patients in whom conventional treatment is ineffective. Because there seems to exist a scientific rationale for the use of C_D005672 at the cytokine level in D_D015212, we suggest that the role of this treatment should be further investigated.

Although initially thought to be free of extrapyramidal side effects, C_D013469-induced D_D004409 and D_D010302 have been reported occasionally. We studied a 37-year-old man who developed persistent segmental D_D004421 within 2 months after starting C_D013469 therapy. We could not find any previous reports of C_D013469-induced D_D004421.

title:Ocular and auditory D_D064420 in hemodialyzed patients receiving C_D003676.
abstract:During an 18-month period of study 41 hemodialyzed patients receiving C_D003676 (10-40 mg/kg BW/3 times weekly) for the first time were monitored for detection of D_D014786|D006311. 6 patients presented clinical symptoms of visual or auditory D_D064420. Moreover, detailed ophthalmologic and audiologic studies disclosed abnormalities in 7 more asymptomatic patients. D_D014786 was of retinal origin and was characterized by a tritan-type D_-1, sometimes associated with D_D014786 and D_D012164. D_D006311 was characterized by a mid- to high-frequency D_D006319 and the lesion was of the cochlear type. C_D003676 withdrawal resulted in a complete recovery of visual function in 1 patient and partial recovery in 3, and a complete reversal of D_D034381 in 3 patients and partial recovery in 3. This D_D064420 appeared in patients receiving the higher doses of C_D003676 or coincided with the normalization of ferritin or C_-1 serum levels. The data indicate that D_D014786|D006311 is not an infrequent complication in hemodialyzed patients receiving C_D003676. Periodical audiovisual monitoring should be performed on hemodialyzed patients receiving the drug in order to detect adverse effects as early as possible.

title:D_D009157 presenting as weakness after C_D008274 administration.
abstract:We studied a patient with no prior history of D_D009468 who became virtually D_D011782 after parenteral C_D008274 administration for D_D011225. The serum C_D008274 concentration was 3.0 mEq/L, which is usually well tolerated. The C_D008274 was stopped and she recovered over a few days. While she was weak, 2-Hz repetitive stimulation revealed a decrement without significant facilitation at rapid rates or after exercise, suggesting D_D009468. After her strength returned, repetitive stimulation was normal, but single fiber EMG revealed increased jitter and blocking. Her C_D000109 receptor antibody level was markedly elevated. Although D_D010243 after C_D008274 administration has been described in patients with known D_D009157, it has not previously been reported to be the initial or only manifestation of the disease. Patients who are unusually sensitive to the neuromuscular effects of C_D008274 should be suspected of having an underlying D_D020511.

title:C_C004656 and its contribution to urotoxicity during treatment with C_D003520 or C_D007069. An experimental study/short communication.
abstract:Based on clinical data, indicating that C_C004656 (C_C004656) is an important metabolite of oxazaphosphorine cytostatics, an experimental study was carried out in order to elucidate the role of C_C004656 in the development of hemorrhagic cystitis. The data demonstrate that C_C004656 after i.v. administration does not contribute to D_D001745. When instilled directly into the bladder, C_C004656 exerts urotoxic effects, it is, however, susceptible to detoxification with C_D015080.

title:Source of D_D010146 and primitive dysfunction in D_D008881: an identical site?
abstract:Twenty common D_D008881 patients received a one sided frontotemporal application of C_D005996 (10 patients) or placebo ointment (10 patients) in a double blind study. Early onset D_D008881 attacks were induced by C_D005996 in seven out of 10 patients versus no patient in the placebo group. Subsequently 20 D_D008881 patients, who developed an early onset attack with frontotemporal C_D005996, received the drug in a second induction test at other body areas. No early onset D_D008881 was observed. Thus the D_D008881-inducing effect of C_D005996 seems to depend on direct stimulation of the habitual site of D_D010146, suggesting that the frontotemporal region is of crucial importance in the development of a D_D008881 crisis. This is not consistent with a CNS origin of D_D008881 attack.

title:C_C084599-induced acute D_D056486.
abstract:We report the case of a patient who developed acute D_D056486 with D_D047508, 7 months after the onset of administration of C_C084599, a C_C013295 derivative. C_C084599 withdrawal was followed by prompt recovery. The administration of several C_D001569, chemically related to C_C084599, did not interfere with recovery and did not induce any relapse of D_D056486. This observation shows that C_C084599 can induce acute D_D056486 and suggests that there is no cross D_D056486 between C_C084599 and several C_D001569.

title:Arterial D_D006973 as a complication of prolonged C_D007654 treatment.
abstract:Two of 14 patients with D_D003480 treated on a long-term basis with C_D007654 developed sustained D_D006973. In both cases normal plasma and urinary free C_D006854 levels had been achieved following C_D007654 therapy, yet continuous blood pressure monitoring demonstrated D_D006973 31 (patient 1) and 52 weeks (patient 2) after treatment. In patient 1, plasma levels of C_D003900 and 11-deoxyC_D006854 were elevated. In patient 2, in addition to an increase in both C_D003900 and 11-deoxyC_D006854 levels, plasma C_D000450 values were raised, with a concomitant suppression of renin levels. Our findings show that long-term treatment with high doses of C_D007654 may induce enzyme blockade leading to mineralocorticoid-related D_D006973.

title:Effects of an inhibitor of C_D000809 converting enzyme (C_D002216) on pulmonary and renal insufficiency due to D_D004211 in the rat.
abstract:Induction of D_D004211 and inhibition of fibrinolysis by injection of thrombin and C_D014148 (C_D014148) in the rat gives rise to pulmonary and renal insufficiency resembling that occurring after D_D014947 or D_D018805 in man. Injection of C_D002216 (1 mg/kg), an inhibitor of C_D000809 converting enzyme (ACE), reduced both pulmonary and renal insufficiency in this rat model. The lung weights were lower and PaO2 was improved in rats given this enzyme-blocking agent. The contents of albumin in the lungs were not changed, indicating that C_D002216 did not influence the extravasation of protein. D_D007674 as reflected by an increase in serum C_D014508 and in kidney weight was prevented by C_D002216. The amount of fibrin in the kidneys was also considerably lower than in animals which received thrombin and C_D014148 alone. It is suggested that the effects of C_D002216 on the lungs may be attributable to a vasodilatory effect due to a reduction in the circulating level of C_D000804 and an increase in C_D011464 (secondary to an increase in C_D001920). C_D002216 may, by the same mechanism, reduce the increase in glomerular filtration that is known to occur after an injection of thrombin, thereby diminishing the aggregation of fibrin monomers in the glomeruli, with the result that less fibrin will be deposited and thus less D_D007674 will be produced.

Each patient was subjected to an identical anesthetic protocol and similar drug-induced D_D007022 (BP) (50 to 55 mmHg). Nitroprusside infusion was associated with a significant (p less than 0.05) D_D016534; rebound D_D006973 was observed in three patients after discontinuation of C_D009599. C_D007741 administration was not associated with any of these findings. Arterial C_C093415 decreased in both groups. It was concluded that C_D007741 offers advantages over C_D009599.

title:Chronic C_D002220 treatment in the rat: efficacy, D_D064420, and effect on plasma and tissue C_D005492 concentrations.
abstract:C_D005492 depletion has often been a problem in chronic antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy. C_D002220 (C_D002220), a commonly used AED, has been implicated in some clinical studies. A rat model was developed to examine the effects of chronic C_D002220 treatment on C_D005492 concentrations in the rat. In the course of developing this model, a common vehicle, C_D019946, by itself in high doses, was found to exhibit protective properties against induced D_D012640 and inhibited D_D015430. D_D012640 induced by C_D005481 (C_D005481) were also found to be a more sensitive measure of protection by C_D002220 than D_D012640 induced by maximal electroshock (MES). Oral administration of C_D002220 as an aqueous suspension every 8 h at a dose of 250 mg/kg was continuously protective against C_D005481-induced D_D012640 and was minimally toxic as measured by D_D015430 over 8 weeks of treatment. The C_D002220 levels measured in plasma and brain of these animals, however, were below those normally considered protective. This treatment with C_D002220 had no apparent adverse effect on C_D005492 concentrations in the rat, and, indeed, the C_D005492 concentration increased in liver after 6 weeks of treatment and in plasma at 8 weeks of treatment.

title:Inhibition of sympathoadrenal activity by atrial natriuretic factor in dogs.
abstract:In six conscious, trained dogs, maintained on a normal C_D012964 intake of 2 to 4 mEq/kg/day, sympathetic activity was assessed as the release rate of C_D009638 and C_D004837 during 15-minute i.v. infusions of human alpha-atrial natriuretic factor. Mean arterial pressure (as a percentage of control +/- SEM) during randomized infusions of 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, or 1.0 microgram/kg/min was 99 +/- 1, 95 +/- 1 (p less than 0.05), 93 +/- 1 (p less than 0.01), or 79 +/- 6% (p less than 0.001), respectively, but no D_D013610 and no augmentation of the C_D009638 release rate (up to 0.3 microgram/kg/min) were observed, which is in contrast to comparable D_D007022 induced by C_D006830 or C_D005996. The release rate of C_D004837 (control, 6.7 +/- 0.6 ng/kg/min) declined immediately during infusions of atrial natriuretic factor to a minimum of 49 +/- 5% of control (p less than 0.001) during 0.1 microgram/kg/min and to 63 +/- 5% (0.1 greater than p greater than 0.05) or 95 +/- 13% (not significant) during 0.3 or 1.0 microgram/kg/min. Steady state arterial plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor were 39 +/- 10 pg/ml (n = 6) during infusions of saline and 284 +/- 24 pg/ml (n = 6) and 1520 +/- 300 pg/ml (n = 9) during 0.03 and 0.1 microgram/kg/min infusions of the factor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

title:D_D003643 from chemotherapy in D_D031901.
abstract:Multiple cytotoxic drug administration is the generally accepted treatment of patients with a high-risk stage of D_D002822. Based on this principle a 27-year old woman, classified as being in the high-risk group (Goldstein and Berkowitz score: 11), was treated with multiple cytotoxic drugs. The multiple drug schema consisted of: C_D005047 16.213, C_D008727, C_D003520, C_D003609, and C_D002945. On the first day of the schedule, moderate high doses of C_D008727, C_D005047 and C_D003520 were administered. Within 8 hours after initiation of therapy the patient died with a clinical picture resembling massive D_D011655 due to choriocarcinomic tissue plugs, probably originating from the uterus. Formation of these plugs was probably due to extensive D_D009369 D_D009336 at the level of the walls of the major uterine veins, which resulted in an open exchange of D_D009369 plugs to the vascular spaces; decrease in D_D009369 tissue coherence secondary to chemotherapy may have further contributed to the formation of D_D009369 emboli. In view of the close time association between the start of chemotherapy and the acute onset of massive D_D004617 other explanations, such as spontaneous D_D009336, must be considered less likely. Patients with large pelvic D_D009369 loads are, according to existing classifications, at high risk to die and to develop drug resistance. Notwithstanding these facts our findings suggest that these patients might benefit from relatively mild initial treatment, especially true for patients not previously exposed to this drug. Close observation of the response status both clinically and with beta-hCG values may indicate whether and when more agressive combination chemotherapy should be started.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Assessments of marital happiness and D_D003866 were also made using the CES-D and the Azrin Marital Happiness Scale (AMHS). D_D012735s were found to be common among patients and controls, the majority in both groups reporting one or more dysfunctions. D_D007172 was more common among male patients than controls and was found to be associated with co-morbidity and the taking of C_D008727. D_D003866 was more common among patients and was associated with certain sexual difficulties, but not with D_D007172. Marital unhappiness, as indicated by AMHS scores, was not associated with D_D001168 but was associated with D_D012735, sexual dissatisfaction and being female.

Her red blood cells (RBCs) had increased incubated Heinz body formation, decreased reduced C_D005978 (C_D005978), and decreased C_D005978 stability. The C_D010428 shunt activity of the C_D003622-exposed AE RBCs was increased compared to normal RBCs. Although the AE RBCs from an individual not taking C_D003622 had increased incubated Heinz body formation, the C_D005978 content and C_D005978 stability were normal. The C_D010428 shunt activity of the non-C_D003622-exposed AE RBCs was decreased compared to normal RBCs. Thus, AE RBCs appear to have an increased sensitivity to oxidant stress both in vitro and in vivo, since C_D003622 does not cause D_D000743 at this dose in hematologically normal individuals. Given the influx of Southeast Asians into the United States, oxidant medications should be used with caution, especially if an D_D007239 is present, in individuals of ethnic backgrounds that have an increased prevalence of hemoglobin E.

title:Severe complications of antianginal drug therapy in a patient identified as a poor metabolizer of C_D008790, C_D011405, C_D004110, and C_D013034.
abstract:A 47-year-old patient suffering from D_D003324 was admitted to the CCU in D_D012769 with III. D_D054537, severe D_D007022, and D_D018754. One week prior to admission a therapy with standard doses of C_D008790 (100 mg t.i.d. and then 100 mg b.i.d.) had been initiated. Two days before admission C_D004110 (60 mg b.i.d.) was prescribed in addition. Analyses of a blood sample revealed unusually high plasma concentrations of C_D008790 (greater than 3000 ng/ml) and C_D004110 (526 ng/ml). The patient recovered within 1 week following discontinuation of antianginal therapy. Three months later the patient was exposed to a single dose of C_D008790, C_D004110, C_D011405 (since he had received this drug in the past), and C_D013034 (as a probe for the C_D003647/C_D013034 type polymorphism of oxidative drug metabolism). It was found that he was a poor metabolizer of all four drugs, indicating that their metabolism is under the same genetic control. Therefore, patients belonging to the poor-metabolizer phenotype of C_D013034/C_D003647 polymorphism in drug metabolism, which constitutes 6.4% of the German population, may experience D_D064420 when treated with standard doses of one of these drugs alone. Moreover, the coadministration of these frequently used drugs is expected to be especially harmful in this subgroup of patients.

D_D001714 excitement was coincident with the duration of action of C_D014229. The possible contribution of the C_D014229 group to changes in affective status is discussed.

title:On the mechanisms of the development of tolerance to the D_D009127 produced by C_D009020 in rats.
abstract:The development of tolerance to the D_D009127 produced by C_D009020 was studied in rats. Saline-pretreated controls given a test dose of C_D009020 (20 mg/kg i.p.) showed a pronounced D_D009127 recorded as tonic activity in the electromyogram. Rats treated for 11 days with C_D009020 and withdrawn for 36-40 h showed differences in the development of tolerance: about half of the animals showed a D_D009127 after the test dose of C_D009020 that was not significantly less than in the controls and were D_D018476 (A group). The other rats showed a strong decrease in the D_D009127 and the occurrence of stereotyped (S) licking and/or gnawing in presence of D_D018476 or D_D006948 (K) behaviour (AS/KS group), suggesting signs of dopaminergic activation. The D_D009127 was considerably decreased in both groups after 20 days' treatment. In a further series of experiments, C_D006220 (0.2 mg/kg i.p.) was used in order to block the dopaminergic activation and to estimate the real degree of the tolerance to the D_D009127 without any dopaminergic interference. C_D006220 enhanced the D_D009127 in the A group. However, the level in the AS/KS group remained considerably lower than in the A group. The results suggest that D_D009127, which is assumed to be due to an action of C_D009020 in the striatum, can be antagonized by another process leading to dopaminergic activation in the striatum. Nevertheless, there occurs some real tolerance to this effect. The rapid alternations of D_D009127 and the signs of dopaminergic activation observed in the animals of the AS/KS group might be due to rapid shifts in the predominance of various DA-innervated structures.

abstract:D_D005355|D009135 is a common, well-known side effect of repeated C_D010423 injection. However, D_D009408 due to fibrotic muscle affected by C_D010423-induced D_D009135 has not previously been reported. In a 37-year-old woman with documented C_D010423-induced D_D005355|D009135 of triceps and deltoid muscles bilaterally and a three-week history of right wrist drop, electrodiagnostic examination showed a severe but partial lesion of the right radial nerve distal to the branches to the triceps, in addition to the D_D005355|D009135. Surgery revealed the right radial nerve to be severely compressed by the densely fibrotic lateral head of the triceps. Decompression and neurolysis were performed with good subsequent recovery of function.

abstract:A patient with cryptogenic D_D005355 and disseminated D_D013174 developed D_D058186 immediately following the administration of C_D000666 B on four separate occasions. The abruptness of the D_D051437 and its reversibility within days suggests that there was a functional component to the D_D007674. We propose that C_D000666, in the setting of reduced effective arterial volume, may activate tubuloglomerular feedback, thereby contributing to D_D058186.

He developed D_D011014, pleural and pericardial effusions, and a predominantly proximal motor D_D009422. Immediate but gradual improvement followed withdrawal of C_D000638 and treatment with C_D011239. Review of this and previously reported cases indicates the need for early diagnosis of C_D000638 D_D011014, immediate withdrawal of C_D000638, and prompt but continued C_D013256 therapy to ensure full recovery.

Prompt restoration of renal function followed drug withdrawal, while re-exposure to a single dose of C_D007213 caused recurrence of acute reversible D_D009846. Our case supports the hypothesis that endogenous renal C_D011453 play a role in the maintenance of renal blood flow when circulating plasma volume is diminished. Since nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents interfere with this compensatory mechanism and may cause acute D_D051437, they should be used with caution in such patients.

title:Comparison of the subjective effects and plasma concentrations following oral and i.m. administration of C_D005445 in volunteers.
abstract:C_D005445 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 mg was given by the oral or i.m. routes to groups of volunteers and its effects compared. Plasma concentrations of the drug were estimated by gas-liquid chromatography, in a smaller number of the subjects. The most striking effect was sedation which increased with the dose, 2 mg producing deep sleep although the subjects could still be aroused. The effects of i.m. administration were apparent earlier and sometimes lasted longer than those following oral administration. D_D004244 was less marked than sedation, but increased with the dose. There was D_D010146 on i.m. injection of C_D005445 significantly more often than with isotonic saline. Plasma concentrations varied with dose and route and corresponded qualitatively with the subjective effects. The drug was still present in measurable quantities after 24 h even with the smallest dose.

title:Changes in heart size during long-term C_D013999 treatment after D_D009203.
abstract:The effect of long-term C_D013999 treatment on heart size after D_D009203 was evaluated by X-ray in a double-blind study including 241 patients (placebo 126, C_D013999 115). The follow-up period was 12 months. The C_D013999-treated patients showed a small but significant increase in heart size from baseline in contrast to a decrease in the placebo group. These differences may be caused by C_D013999-induced D_D001919 and a compensatory increase in end-diastolic volume. The C_D013999-related increase in heart size was observed only in patients with normal and borderline heart size. In patients with D_D006332, the increase in heart size was similar in both groups. After re-D_D007238, heart size increased in the placebo group and remained unchanged in the C_D013999 group.

title:C_D002762 D_D064420 in dairy cows.
abstract:Large parenteral doses of C_D002762 (15 to 17.5 x 10(6) IU C_D002762) were associated with prolonged D_D006934, D_D054559, and large increases of C_D002762 and its metabolites in the blood plasma of nonlactating nonpregnant and pregnant Jersey cows. C_D002118 concentrations 1 day postpartum were higher in cows treated with C_D002762 about 32 days prepartum (8.8 mg/100 ml) than in control cows (5.5 mg/100 ml). None of the cows treated with C_D002762 showed signs of D_D010319 during the peripartal period; however, 22% of the control cows developed clinical signs of D_D010319 during this period. Signs of C_D002762 D_D064420 were not observed in nonlactating nonpregnant cows; however, pregnant cows commonly developed severe signs of C_D002762 D_D064420 and 10 of 17 cows died. There was widespread metastatic calcification in the cows that died. Because of the extreme D_D064420 of C_D002762 in pregnant Jersey cows and the low margin of safety between doses of C_D002762 that prevent D_D010319 and doses that induce D_D010319, we concluded that C_D002762 cannot be used practically to prevent D_D010319 when injected several weeks prepartum.

title:D_D010523 as seen in the Nigerian African.
abstract:The anatomical and aetiological diagnoses of D_D010523 excluding its primary benign and malignant disorders, as seen in 358 Nigerians are presented. There is a male preponderance and the peak incidence is in the fourth decade. D_D010523 was the commonest presentation (50%). D_D020275 was the commonest identifiable cause (15.6%), accounting for half of the cases with D_D010523. D_D010523 due to D_D044342 of C_D013831 and C_D012256 was common (10.1%) and presented mainly as sensory and sensori-D_D010523. D_D003920 was the major cause of D_D009422. C_D007538 was the most frequent agent in drug-induced D_D009422. D_D008881 (20%) was not an uncommon cause of cranial D_D009422 although D_D009369 arising from the reticuloendothelial system or related structures of the head and neck were more frequent (26%). In 26.5% of all the cases, the aetiology of the D_D009422 was undetermined. Heredofamilial and D_D003240 were rare. Some of the factors related to the clinical presentation and pathogenesis of the D_D009422 are briefly discussed.

abstract:In a 6-week double-blind parallel treatment study, C_D004308 and C_D000639 were compared to placebo in the treatment of 33 D_D003866 outpatients. C_D004308 and C_D000639 were equally effective in alleviating the symptoms of D_D003866, and both were significantly superior to placebo. The overall incidence of side effects and the frequency and severity of D_D014786, D_D014987, and drowsiness were significantly less with C_D004308 than with C_D000639. C_D004308 also produced fewer CNS and cardiovascular effects. There were no clinically important changes in laboratory parameters. C_D004308 thus was found to be an effective C_D000928 drug associated with fewer side effects than C_D000639 in the treatment of D_D003866 outpatients.

Patients tapped faster after C_D011433 than C_D003975 and they were more sedated after C_D003975 than C_D011433. After 2 weeks of treatment, patients tested 5-8 h after the last dose of medication did not show any decrement of performance. These results are similar to those previously found in healthy subjects. Accumulation of drugs was not reflected in prolonged D_D001523.

title:Effect of C_D001241 on C_D005200-induced epithelial proliferation in the urinary bladder and forestomach of the rat.
abstract:The co-administration of C_D001241 with C_D005200 (C_D005200) to rats resulted in a reduced incidence of C_D005200-induced D_D001749 but a concomitant induction of D_D013274. An autoradiographic study was performed on male F-344 rats fed diet containing C_D005200 at a level of 0.2% and/or C_D001241 at a level of 0.5% to evaluate the effect of C_D001241 on the increased cell proliferation induced by C_D005200 in the forestomach and bladder. C_D005200-induced cell proliferation in the bladder was significantly suppressed by C_D001241 co-administration after 4 weeks but not after 12 weeks. In the forestomach, and also in the liver, C_D001241 did not affect the C_D005200-induced increase in labeling index. The present results are consistent with the carcinogenicity experiment suggesting that different mechanisms are involved in C_D005200 D_D063646 in the bladder and forestomach, and that C_D001241's effect on C_D005200 in the forestomach is not due to an irritant effect associated with increased cell proliferation. Also, there appears to be an adaptation by the rats to the chronic ingestion of C_D001241.

abstract:The effect of C_D005996 on heart rate and systolic blood pressure was compared in 5 normal subjects, 12 D_D003920 subjects without D_D009422, and 5 D_D003920 subjects with D_D009422. The magnitude and time course of the increase in heart rate and the decrease in systolic blood pressure after C_D005996 were similar in the normal and D_D003920 subjects without D_D009422, whereas a lesser increase in heart rate and a greater decrease in systolic blood pressure occurred in the D_D003920 subjects with D_D009422. It is therefore suggested that caution should be exercised when prescribing vasodilator drugs in D_D003920 patients, particularly those with D_D009422.

title:Characterization of C_D004967-induced D_D010911 in the Fischer 344 rat.
abstract:D_D010911 were induced in F344 female rats by chronic treatment with C_D004054 (C_D004054, 8-10 mg) implanted subcutaneously in silastic capsules. Over a range of 1-150 days of C_D004054 treatment, pairs of control and C_D004054-treated rats were sacrificed, and their pituitaries dissociated enzymatically into single-cell preparations. The cell populations were examined regarding total cell recovery correlated with gland weight, intracellular prolactin (PRL) content and subsequent release in primary culture, immunocytochemical PRL staining, density and/or size alterations via separation on Ficoll-Hypaque and by unit gravity sedimentation, and cell cycle analysis, after C_D000167 DNA staining, by laser flow cytometry. Total cell yields from C_D004054-treated pituitaries increased from 1.3 times control yields at 8 days of treatment to 58.9 times control values by day 150. Intracellular PRL content ranged from 1.9 to 9.4 times control levels, and PRL release in vitro was significantly and consistently higher than controls, after at least 8 days of C_D004054 exposure. Beyond 8 days of C_D004054 exposure, the immunochemically PRL-positive proportion of cells increased to over 50% of the total population. Increased density and/or size and PRL content were indicated for the majority of the PRL cell population in both types of separation protocols. All these effects of C_D004054 were more pronounced among previously ovariectomized animals. The data extend the findings of other investigators, further establishing the C_D004054-induced D_D009369 as a model for study of PRL cellular control mechanisms.

title:Metabolic involvement in C_D004317 D_D066126.
abstract:The D_D066126 effects of C_D004317 were studied in mammalian myocardial cells in culture as a model system. C_D004317 inhibited cell growth and the rhythmic contractions characteristic of myocardial cells in culture. A possible involvement of energy metabolism was suggested previously, and in this study the adenylate energy charge and C_D010725 mole fraction were determined in the C_D004317-treated cells. The adenylate energy charge was found to be significantly decreased, while the C_D010725 mole fraction was unchanged. Such disparity suggests an inhibition of C_D003401 phosphokinase. The addition of 1 mM C_D000241 to the myocardial cell cultures markedly increases the C_D000255 concentration through a pathway reportedly leading to a compartmentalized C_D000255 pool. In the C_D004317-treated cells, the addition of C_D000241 increased the adenylate charge and, concomitant with this inrcease, the cells' functional integrity, in terms of percentage of beating cells and rate of contractions, was maintained.

The temporal relationship between lipid peroxidation in the kidney and D_D011507 was examined in this study. Rats were treated with a single IV injection of C_D011692, (C_D011692, 7.5 mg/kg) and 24 hour urine samples were obtained prior to sacrifice on days 3,5,7,10,17,27,41 (N = 5-10 per group). The kidneys were removed, flushed with ice cold TRIS buffer. Kidney cortices from each animal were used to prepare homogenates. Tissue lipid peroxidation was measured in whole homogenates as well as in lipid extracts from homogenates as C_C029684 reactive substances. D_D011507 was evident at day 5, peaked at day 7 and persisted to day 27. Lipid peroxidation in homogenates was maximal at day 3 and declined rapidly to control levels by day 17. This study supports the role of lipid peroxidation in mediating the D_D011507 in C_D011692 D_D007674.

title:C_D002997-induced D_D012893 does not impair its prolactin-releasing action.
abstract:The present study was undertaken to examine the role of D_D012893, induced by C_D002997 administration, on the secretory rate of prolactin (PRL) in addition to the direct drug effect. Two groups of supine subjects were studied under placebo-controlled conditions, one during the night, when sleeping (n = 7) and the other at daytime, when awake (n = 6). Each subject received a single 50 mg dose of C_D002997 given orally 2 hours before blood collection. Plasma PRL concentrations were analysed at 10 min intervals and underlying secretory rates calculated by a deconvolution procedure. For both experiments the drug intake led to significant increases in PRL secretion, acting preferentially on tonic secretion as pulse amplitude and frequency did not differ significantly from corresponding control values. During the night C_D002997 ingestion altered the complete sleep architecture in that it suppressed REM sleep and the sleep cycles and induced increased wakefulness. As the relative increase in PRL secretion expressed as a percentage of the mean did not significantly differ between the night and day time studies (46 +/- 19% vs 34 +/- 10%), it can be concluded that the observed D_D012893 did not interfere with the drug action per se. The presence of REM sleep was shown not to be a determining factor either for secretory pulse amplitude and frequency, as, for both, mean nocturnal values were similar with and without prior C_D002997 ingestion.

abstract:A 72-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with "flash" D_D011654, preceded by D_D002637, requiring intubation. Her medical history included D_D003324 with previous D_D009203, D_D006973, and D_D003920. A history of D_D000799 secondary to C_D017706 therapy was elicited. Current medications did not include C_D000809-converting enzyme inhibitors or beta-blockers. She had no previous beta-blocking drug exposure. During the first day of hospitalization (while intubated), intravenous C_D008790 was given, resulting in severe D_D000799. The D_D000799 resolved after therapy with intravenous C_D013256 and C_D004155 hydrochloride.

title:Effect of C_C007112 on the developing chick embryo.
abstract:C_C007112, an alkaloid from Conium maculatum (poison hemlock), has been shown to be teratogenic in livestock. The major teratogenic outcome is D_D001176, presumably due to nicotinic receptor blockade. However, C_C007112 has failed to produce D_D001176 in rats or mice and is only weakly teratogenic in rabbits. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of C_C007112 and C_D009538 in the developing chick. Concentrations of C_C007112 and C_D009538 sulfate were 0.015%, 0.03%, 0.075%, 0.15%, 0.75%, 1.5%, 3%, and 6% and 1%, 5%, and 10%, respectively. Both compounds caused D_D009140 and lethality in a dose-dependent manner. All concentrations of C_D009538 sulfate caused some lethality but a no effect level for C_C007112 lethality was 0.75%. The D_D009140 caused by both C_C007112 and C_D009538 sulfate were D_D009140. No histopathological alterations or differences in bone formation were seen in the limbs or toes of any chicks from any group; however, extensive D_D002543 occurred in all C_D009538 sulfate-treated chicks. There was a statistically significant (P < or = 0.01) decrease in movement in C_C007112 and C_D009538 sulfate treated chicks as determined by ultrasound. Control chicks were in motion an average of 33.67% of the time, while C_C007112-treated chicks were only moving 8.95% of a 5-min interval, and no movement was observed for C_D009538 sulfate treated chicks. In summary, the chick embryo provides a reliable and simple experimental animal model of C_C007112-induced D_D001176. Data from this model support a mechanism involving nicotinic receptor blockade with subsequent decreased fetal movement.

title:Epidural blood flow during C_D000527 or C_D014294 induced D_D007022.
abstract:To evaluate the effect of C_D000527 (C_D000527) or C_D014294 (C_D014294) induced D_D007022 on epidural blood flow (EBF) during spinal surgery, EBF was measured using the heat clearance method in 30 patients who underwent postero-lateral interbody fusion under C_D007530 anaesthesia. An initial dose of 0.1 microgram.kg-1.min-1 of C_D000527 (15 patients), or 10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 of C_D014294 (15 patients) was administered intravenously after the dural opening and the dose was adjusted to maintain the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) at about 60 mmHg. The D_D007022 drug was discontinued at the completion of the operative procedure. After starting C_D000527 or C_D014294, MAP and rate pressure product (RPP) decreased significantly compared with preinfusion values (P < 0.01), and the degree of D_D007022 due to C_D000527 remained constant until 60 min after its discontinuation. Heart rate (HR) did not change in either group. EBFF did not change during C_D000527 infusion whereas in the C_D014294 group, EBF decreased significantly at 30 and 60 min after the start of C_D014294 (preinfusion: 45.9 +/- 13.9 ml/100g/min. 30 min: 32.3 +/- 9.9 ml/100 g/min (P < 0.05). 60 min: 30 +/- 7.5 ml/100 g/min (P < 0.05)). These results suggest that C_D000527 may be preferable to C_D014294 for D_D007022 anaesthesia in spinal surgery because C_D014294 decreased EBF.

title:Immunohistochemical studies with antibodies to neurofilament proteins on D_D001480 in experimental focal lesions in rat.
abstract:Immunohistochemistry with monoclonal antibodies against neurofilament (NF) proteins of middle and high molecular weight class, NF-M and NF-H, was used to study D_D001480 in the borderzone of focal lesions in rats. Focal D_D001480 was produced by infusion of C_D019344 at acid pH or by stab caused by needle insertion. D_D002544 were evoked by prolonged C_D010862-induced D_D013226. Immunohistochemical staining for NFs showed characteristic terminal clubs of axons in the borderzone of lesions. Differences in the labelling pattern occurred with different antibodies which apparently depended on molecular weight class of NFs and phosphorylation state. These immunohistochemical changes of NFs can serve as a marker for D_D001480 in various experimental D_D014947 or ischemic lesions.

title:C_D000082-induced D_D007022.
abstract:Through 30 years of widespread use, C_D000082 has been shown to be a remarkably safe medication in therapeutic dosages. The potential for C_D000082 to produce D_D002318 is very low. However, C_D000082 has been demonstrated to produce symptoms of D_D000707, including D_D007022, in sensitive individuals. This article describes two D_D016638 patients in whom transient episodes of D_D007022 reproducibly developed after administration of C_D000082. Other symptoms of D_D004342 were not clinically detectable. The D_D007022 episodes were severe enough to require vasopressor administration. The reports illustrate the need for clinicians to consider C_D000082 in patients with D_D007022 of unknown origin.

abstract:An 80-yr-old man developed acute D_D056486 shortly after ingesting oral C_D002443. Although the transaminases gradually returned to baseline after withholding the C_D047090 antibiotic, there was a gradual increase in serum C_D001663 and a decrease in hemoglobin concentration caused by an D_D000744 and D_-1. These responded to systemic C_D013256 and immunoglobulins. Despite the widespread use of these agents this triad of side effects has not previously been reported in connection with C_D047090 antibiotics.

title:Adverse effects of the atypical antipsychotics. Collaborative Working Group on Clinical Trial Evaluations.
abstract:Adverse effects of antipsychotics often lead to noncompliance. Thus, clinicians should address patients' concerns about adverse effects and attempt to choose medications that will improve their patients' quality of life as well as overall health. The side effect profiles of the atypical antipsychotics are more advantageous than those of the conventional neuroleptics. Conventional agents are associated with unwanted central nervous system effects, including D_D001480 (D_D001480), D_D004409, sedation, and possible impairment of some cognitive measures, as well as cardiac effects, D_D007024, hepatic changes, anticholinergic side effects, D_D012735, and D_D015430. The newer atypical agents have a lower risk of D_D001480, but are associated in varying degrees with sedation, cardiovascular effects, anticholinergic effects, D_D015430, D_D012735, hepatic effects, lowered D_D012640 threshold (primarily C_D003024), and D_D000380 (C_D003024 only). Since the incidence and severity of specific adverse effects differ among the various atypicals, the clinician should carefully consider which side effects are most likely to lead to the individual's dissatisfaction and noncompliance before choosing an antipsychotic for a particular patient.

title:Effects of C_C009438 and C_C060802 on experimental D_D013927 in mice and human D_D001791.
abstract:C_C009438 (C_C009438) and C_C060802 (C_C060802) are two naturally occurring analogues with a C_D044182 structure. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of C_C009438 and C_C060802 on the experimental D_D013927 induced by collagen plus C_D004837 (C_D004837) in mice, and D_D001791 and D_D001778 in vitro. In the in vivo study, the administration (50 mg/kg, i.p.) of C_C009438 and C_C060802 in mice showed the inhibition of D_D013927 by 55% and 35%, respectively, while C_D001241 (C_D001241, 50 mg/kg, i.p.), a positive control, showed only 30% inhibition. In the vitro human D_D001791s induced by the agonists used in tests, C_C009438 and C_C060802 showed the inhibitions dose dependently. In addition, neither C_C009438 nor C_C060802 showed any anticoagulation activities in the measurement of the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT) and thrombin time (TT) using human-citrated plasma. These results suggest that antiD_D013927 of C_C009438 and C_C060802 in mice may be mainly related to the antiD_D001791 activities.

title:C_C056507 plus C_C030852 in D_D002289 patients age 70 years or older or patients who cannot receive C_D002945. Oncopaz Cooperative Group.
abstract:BACKGROUND: Although the prevalence of D_D002289 (D_D002289) is high among elderly patients, few data are available regarding the efficacy and D_D064420 of chemotherapy in this group of patients. Recent reports indicate that single agent therapy with C_C030852 (C_C030852) or C_C056507 (C_C056507) may obtain a response rate of 20-30% in elderly patients, with acceptable D_D064420 and improvement in symptoms and quality of life. In the current study the efficacy and D_D064420 of the combination of C_C056507 and C_C030852 in elderly patients with advanced D_D002289 or those with some contraindication to receiving C_D002945 were assessed. METHODS: Forty-nine patients with advanced D_D002289 were included, 38 of whom were age >/= 70 years and 11 were age < 70 years but who had some contraindication to receiving C_D002945. All patients were evaluable for response and D_D064420. Treatment was comprised of C_C030852, 25 mg/m(2), plus C_C056507, 1000 mg/m(2), both on Days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days. Patients received a minimum of three courses unless progressive disease was detected. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-five courses were administered, with a median of 3. 6 courses per patient. The overall response rate was 26% (95% confidence interval, 15-41%). Two patients attained a complete response (4%) and 11 patients (22%) achieved a partial response. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status improved in 35% of those patients with an initial value > 0, whereas relief of at least 1 symptom without worsening of other symptoms was noted in 27 patients (55%). The median time to progression was 16 weeks and the 1-year survival rate was 33%. D_D064420 was mild. Six patients (12%) had World Health Organization Grade 3-4 D_D009503, 2 patients (4%) had Grade 3-4 D_D013921, and 2 patients (4%) had Grade 3 neuroD_D064420. Three patients with severe D_D009503 (6%) died of D_D018805. The median age of those patients developing Grade 3-4 D_D009503 was significantly higher than that of the remaining patients (75 years vs. 72 years; P = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of C_C056507 and C_C030852 is moderately active and well tolerated except in patients age >/= 75 years. This age group had an increased risk of D_D001855. Therefore the prophylactic use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor should be considered with this treatment. New chemotherapy combinations with higher activity and lower D_D064420 are needed for elderly patients with advanced D_D002289.

title:C_D014859-induced D_D061205 is accelerated by growth and C_D014807.
abstract:The present studies demonstrate that growth and C_D014807 treatment enhance the extent of D_D061205 in rats given sufficient doses of C_D014859 to inhibit gamma-carboxylation of matrix Gla protein, a D_D002114 inhibitor known to be expressed by smooth muscle cells and macrophages in the artery wall. The first series of experiments examined the influence of age and growth status on D_D061205 in C_D014859-treated rats. Treatment for 2 weeks with C_D014859 caused massive focal D_D002114 of the artery media in 20-day-old rats and less extensive focal D_D002114 in 42-day-old rats. In contrast, no D_D061205 could be detected in 10-month-old adult rats even after 4 weeks of C_D014859 treatment. To directly examine the importance of growth to C_D014859-induced D_D061205 in animals of the same age, 20-day-old rats were fed for 2 weeks either an ad libitum diet or a 6-g/d restricted diet that maintains weight but prevents growth. Concurrent treatment of both dietary groups with C_D014859 produced massive focal D_D002114 of the artery media in the ad libitum-fed rats but no detectable D_D061205 in the restricted-diet, growth-inhibited group. Although the explanation for the association between D_D061205 and growth status cannot be determined from the present study, there was a relationship between higher serum C_D010710 and susceptibility to D_D061205, with 30% higher levels of serum C_D010710 in young, ad libitum-fed rats compared with either of the groups that was resistant to C_D014859-induced D_D061205, ie, the 10-month-old rats and the restricted-diet, growth-inhibited young rats. This observation suggests that increased susceptibility to C_D014859-induced D_D061205 could be related to higher serum C_D010710 levels. The second set of experiments examined the possible synergy between C_D014807 and C_D014859 in D_D061205. High doses of C_D014807 are known to cause D_D002114 of the artery media in as little as 3 to 4 days. High doses of the C_D014812 antagonist C_D014859 are also known to cause D_D002114 of the artery media, but at treatment times of 2 weeks or longer yet not at 1 week. In the current study, we investigated the synergy between these 2 treatments and found that concurrent C_D014859 administration dramatically increased the extent of D_D002114 in the media of C_D014807-treated rats at 3 and 4 days. There was a close parallel between the effect of C_D014807 dose on D_D061205 and the effect of C_D014807 dose on the elevation of serum C_D002118, which suggests that C_D014807 may induce D_D061205 through its effect on serum C_D002118. Because C_D014859 treatment had no effect on the elevation in serum C_D002118 produced by C_D014807, the synergy between C_D014859 and C_D014807 is probably best explained by the hypothesis that C_D014859 inhibits the activity of matrix Gla protein as a D_D002114 inhibitor. High levels of matrix Gla protein are found at sites of D_D061205 in rats treated with C_D014807 plus C_D014859, and chemical analysis showed that the protein that accumulated was indeed not C_D015055. These observations indicate that although the C_D015055 residues of matrix Gla protein are apparently required for its function as a D_D002114 inhibitor, they are not required for its accumulation at D_D002114 sites.

title:C_D000928-induced D_D001714 in D_D001714 patients: identification of risk factors.
abstract:BACKGROUND: Concerns about possible risks of switching to D_D001714 associated with C_D000928 continue to interfere with the establishment of an optimal treatment paradigm for D_D001714 depression. METHOD: The response of 44 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for D_D001714 disorder to naturalistic treatment was assessed for at least 6 weeks using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and the Bech-Rafaelson Mania Rating Scale. Patients who experienced a D_D001714 or hypoD_D001714 switch were compared with those who did not on several variables including age, sex, diagnosis (DSM-IV D_D001714 I vs. D_D001714 II), number of previous D_D001714 episodes, type of C_D000928 therapy used (electroconvulsive therapy vs. C_D000928 drugs and, more particularly, selective C_D017367 [C_D017367]), use and type of mood stabilizers (C_D008094 vs. anticonvulsants), and temperament of the patient, assessed during a normothymic period using the hyperthymia component of the Semi-structured Affective Temperament Interview. RESULTS: Switches to hypoD_D001714 or D_D001714 occurred in 27% of all patients (N = 12) (and in 24% of the subgroup of patients treated with C_D017367 [8/33]); 16% (N = 7) experienced D_D001714 episodes, and 11% (N = 5) experienced hypoD_D001714 episodes. Sex, age, diagnosis (D_D001714 I vs. D_D001714 II), and additional treatment did not affect the risk of switching. The incidence of mood switches seemed not to differ between patients receiving an anticonvulsant and those receiving no mood stabilizer. In contrast, mood switches were less frequent in patients receiving C_D008094 (15%, 4/26) than in patients not treated with C_D008094 (44%, 8/18; p = .04). The number of previous D_D001714 episodes did not affect the probability of switching, whereas a high score on the hyperthymia component of the Semistructured Affective Temperament Interview was associated with a greater risk of switching (p = .008). CONCLUSION: The frequency of mood switching associated with acute C_D000928 therapy may be reduced by C_D008094 treatment. Particular attention should be paid to patients with a hyperthymic temperament, who have a greater risk of mood switches.

abstract:Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is implicated in D_D009202 (D_D009202) and in elevated plasma C_D019344 (C_D019344) in D_D000163 through mechanisms of D_D028361. To determine mitochondrial events from HAART in vivo, 8-week-old hemizygous transgenic D_D000163 mice (NL4-3Delta gag/pol; TG) and wild-type FVB/n littermates were treated with the HAART combination of C_D015215, C_D019259, and C_D019469 or vehicle control for 10 days or 35 days. At termination of the experiments, mice underwent echocardiography, quantitation of abundance of molecular markers of D_D009202 (ventricular mRNA encoding atrial natriuretic factor [ANF] and sarcoplasmic C_D002118 ATPase [SERCA2]), and determination of plasma C_D019344. Myocardial histologic features were analyzed semiquantitatively and results were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. After 35 days in the TG + HAART cohort, left ventricular mass increased 160% by echocardiography. Molecularly, ANF mRNA increased 250% and SERCA2 mRNA decreased 57%. Biochemically, C_D019344 was elevated (8.5 +/- 2.0 mM). Pathologically, granular cytoplasmic changes were found in cardiac myocytes, indicating enlarged, damaged mitochondria. Findings were confirmed ultrastructurally. No changes were found in other cohorts. After 10 days, only ANF was elevated, and only in the TG + HAART cohort. Results show that cumulative HAART caused mitochondrial D_D009202 with elevated C_D019344 in D_D000163 transgenic mice.

title:C_D003276 and the risk of D_D009203.
abstract:BACKGROUND: An association between the use of C_D003276 and the risk of D_D009203 has been found in some, but not all, studies. We investigated this association, according to the type of C_D011372 included in third-generation (i.e., C_D017135 or C_C033273) and second-generation (i.e., C_D016912) C_D003276, the dose of C_D004967, and the presence or absence of prothrombotic mutations METHODS: In a nationwide, population-based, case-control study, we identified and enrolled 248 women 18 through 49 years of age who had had a first D_D009203 between 1990 and 1995 and 925 control women who had not had a D_D009203 and who were matched for age, calendar year of the index event, and area of residence. Subjects supplied information on C_D003276 use and major cardiovascular risk factors. An analysis for factor V Leiden and the G20210A mutation in the prothrombin gene was conducted in 217 patients and 763 controls RESULTS: The odds ratio for D_D009203 among women who used any type of combined C_D003276, as compared with nonusers, was 2.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 2.8). The adjusted odds ratio was 2.5 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 4.1) among women who used second-generation C_D003276 and 1.3 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.7 to 2.5) among those who used third-generation C_D003276. Among women who used C_D003276, the odds ratio was 2.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 3.0) for those without a prothrombotic mutation and 1.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.6 to 5.5) for those with a mutation CONCLUSIONS: The risk of D_D009203 was increased among women who used second-generation C_D003276. The results with respect to the use of third-generation C_D003276 were inconclusive but suggested that the risk was lower than the risk associated with second-generation C_D003276. The risk of D_D009203 was similar among women who used C_D003276 whether or not they had a prothrombotic mutation.

title:Effects of 5-HT1B receptor ligands microinjected into the accumbal shell or core on the C_D003042-induced D_D009069 in rats.
abstract:The present study was designed to examine the effect of 5-HT1B receptor ligands microinjected into the subregions of the nucleus accumbens (the shell and the core) on the D_D009069 induced by C_D003042 in rats. Male Wistar rats were implanted bilaterally with cannulae into the accumbens shell or core, and then were locally injected with C_C103477 (an antagonist of 5-HT1B receptors) or C_C065046 (an agonist of 5-HT1B receptors). Given alone to any accumbal subregion, C_C103477 (0.1-10 microg/side) or C_C065046 (0.1-10 microg/side) did not change basal locomotor activity. Systemic C_D003042 (10 mg/kg) significantly increased the locomotor activity of rats. C_C103477 (0.1-10 microg/side), administered intra-accumbens shell prior to C_D003042, dose-dependently attenuated the psychostimulant-induced D_D009069. Such attenuation was not found in animals which had been injected with C_C103477 into the accumbens core. When injected into the accumbens shell (but not the core) before C_D003042, C_C065046 (0.1-10 microg/side) enhanced the locomotor response to C_D003042; the maximum effect being observed after 10 microg/side of the agonist. The later enhancement was attenuated after intra-accumbens shell treatment with C_C103477 (1 microg/side). Our findings indicate that C_D003042 induced D_D009069 is modified by 5-HT1B receptor ligands microinjected into the accumbens shell, but not core, this modification consisting in inhibitory and facilitatory effects of the 5-HT1B receptor antagonist (C_C103477) and agonist (C_C065046), respectively. In other words, the present results suggest that the accumbal shell 5-HT1B receptors play a permissive role in the behavioural response to the psychostimulant.

title:C_D013988-induced cholestatic hepatitis.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: To report 2 cases of C_D013988-induced cholestatic hepatitis, investigate its mechanism, and compare the observed main characteristics with those of the published cases. CASE SUMMARIES: Two patients developed prolonged cholestatic hepatitis after receiving C_D013988 following percutaneous coronary angioplasty, with complete remission during the follow-up period. T-cell stimulation by therapeutic concentration of C_D013988 was demonstrated in vitro in the patients, but not in healthy controls. DISCUSSION: Cholestatic hepatitis is a rare complication of the antiplatelet agent C_D013988; several cases have been reported but few in the English literature. Our patients developed D_D007565 following treatment with C_D013988 and showed the clinical and laboratory characteristics of cholestatic hepatitis, which resolved after discontinuation of the drug. D_D056486 may develop weeks after discontinuation of the drug and may run a prolonged course, but complete remission was observed in all reported cases. An objective causality assessment revealed that the adverse drug event was probably related to the use of C_D013988. The mechanisms of this C_D013988-induced D_D002779 are unclear. Immune mechanisms may be involved in the drug's D_D056486, as suggested by the T-cell stimulation study reported here. CONCLUSIONS: Cholestatic hepatitis is a rare adverse effect of C_D013988 that may be immune mediated. Patients receiving the drug should be monitored with liver function tests along with complete blood cell counts. This complication will be observed even less often in the future as C_D013988 is being replaced by the newer antiplatelet agent C_C055162.

title:Epithelial C_D012964 channel (ENaC) subunit mRNA and protein expression in rats with C_D011692-induced D_D009404.
abstract:In experimental D_D009404, urinary C_D012964 excretion is decreased during the early phase of the disease. The molecular mechanism(s) leading to salt retention has not been completely elucidated. The rate-limiting constituent of collecting duct C_D012964 transport is the epithelial C_D012964 channel (ENaC). We examined the abundance of ENaC subunit mRNAs and proteins in C_D011692 (C_D011692)-induced D_D009404. The time courses of urinary C_D012964 excretion, plasma C_D000450 concentration and D_D011507 were studied in male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with a single dose of either C_D011692 or vehicle. The relative amounts of alphaENaC, betaENaC and gammaENaC mRNAs were determined in kidneys from these rats by real-time quantitative TaqMan PCR, and the amounts of proteins by Western blot. The kinetics of urinary C_D012964 excretion and the appearance of D_D011507 were comparable with those reported previously. C_D012964 retention occurred on days 2, 3 and 6 after C_D011692 injection. A significant up-regulation of alphaENaC and betaENaC mRNA abundance on days 1 and 2 preceded C_D012964 retention on days 2 and 3. Conversely, down-regulation of alphaENaC, betaENaC and gammaENaC mRNA expression on day 3 occurred in the presence of high C_D000450 concentrations, and was followed by a return of C_D012964 excretion to control values. The amounts of alphaENaC, betaENaC and gammaENaC proteins were not increased during C_D011692-induced C_D012964 retention. In conclusion, ENaC mRNA expression, especially alphaENaC, is increased in the very early phase of the experimental model of C_D011692-induced D_D009404 in rats, but appears to escape from the regulation by C_D000450 after day 3.

title:C_D009569-induced D_D008881 attack: strong increase in plasma C_D015740 (C_D015740) concentration and negative correlation with platelet C_D012701 release.
abstract:The aim of the present study was to investigate changes in the plasma C_D015740 (C_D015740) concentration and platelet C_D012701 (C_D012701, C_D012701) content during the immediate D_D006261 and the delayed genuine D_D008881 attack provoked by C_D005996. Fifteen female D_D008881urs (without aura) and eight controls participated in the study. Sublingual C_D005996 (0.5 mg) was administered. Blood was collected from the antecubital vein four times: 60 min before and after the C_D005996 application, and 60 and 120 min after the beginning of the D_D008881 attack (mean 344 and 404 min; 12 subjects). In those subjects who had no D_D008881 attack (11 subjects) a similar time schedule was used. Plasma C_D015740 concentration increased significantly (P<0.01) during the D_D008881 attack and returned to baseline after the cessation of the D_D008881. In addition, both change and peak, showed significant positive correlations with D_D008881 D_D006261 intensity (P<0.001). However, plasma C_D015740 concentrations failed to change during immediate D_D006261 and in the subjects with no D_D008881 attack. Basal C_D015740 concentration was significantly higher and platelet C_D012701 content tended to be lower in subjects who experienced a D_D008881 attack. Platelet C_D012701 content decreased significantly (P<0.01) after C_D005996 in subjects with no D_D008881 attack but no consistent change was observed in patients with D_D008881 attack. In conclusion, the fact that plasma C_D015740 concentration correlates with the timing and severity of a D_D008881 D_D006261 suggests a direct relationship between C_D015740 and D_D008881. In contrast, C_D012701 release from platelets does not provoke D_D008881, it may even counteract the D_D006261 and the concomitant C_D015740 release in this model.

title:D_D003323 after implantation of a C_D017239-eluting stent.
abstract:Formation of D_D003323 is a rare complication of stenting with bare metal stents, but based on experimental studies drug-eluting stents may induce toxic effects on the vessel wall with incomplete stent apposition, D_D000783 formation and with the potential of stent D_D013927 or D_-1. We present a 43-year-old man who developed a D_D003323 in the right coronary artery 6 months after receiving a C_D017239-eluting stent. The patient was asymptomatic and the D_D000783 was detected in a routine control. Angiography and intracoronary ultrasound demonstrated lack of contact between stent and vessel wall in a 15-mm long segment with maximal D_D000783 diameter of 6.0 mm. The patient was successfully treated with a graft stent.

title:Behavioral effects of C_D014579 centrally administered in mice.
abstract:C_D014579 (C_D014579) receptors are widely distributed in the central nervous system. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of C_D014579 causes D_D006973 and D_D001919 and stimulates prolactin and thyrotropin secretion. However, the behavioral effects of centrally administered C_D014579 have received little attention. In the present study, we tested the effects of i.c.v. injections of C_D014579 on behavioral, metabolic, and endocrine responses in mice. Administration of graded doses of C_D014579 (1-10,000 ng/mouse) provoked: (1) a dose-dependent reduction in the number of head dips in the hole-board test; (2) a dose-dependent reduction in the number of entries in the white chamber in the black-and-white compartment test, and in the number of entries in the central platform and open arms in the plus-maze test; and (3) a dose-dependent increase in the duration of immobility in the forced-swimming test and tail suspension test. Intracerebroventricular injection of C_D014579 also caused an increase in: food intake at doses of 100 and 1,000 ng/mouse, water intake at doses of 100-10,000 ng/mouse, and horizontal locomotion activity at a dose of 10,000 ng/mouse. Whatever was the dose, the central administration of C_D014579 had no effect on body temperature, nociception, C_D001058-induced D_D010409 and climbing behavior, and stress-induced plasma C_D003345 level. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that the central injection of C_D014579 at doses of 1-10,000 ng/mouse induces anxiogenic- and depressant-like effects in mouse. These data suggest that C_D014579 may be involved in some aspects of D_D001523.

Her symptoms totally regressed after drug withdrawal and reappeared when C_D017255 was reintroduced. To our knowledge, this is the first case of C_D017255-induced D_D055154. This effect may be related to the pharmacological effect of this drug on mucous membranes.

title:Pharmacological modulation of D_D010146-related brain activity during normal and central sensitization states in humans.
abstract:Abnormal processing of somatosensory inputs in the central nervous system (central sensitization) is the mechanism accounting for the enhanced D_D010146 sensitivity in the skin surrounding D_D017695 (D_D006930). D_D006930 shares clinical characteristics with D_D006930 in patients with neuropathic D_D010146. Abnormal brain responses to somatosensory stimuli have been found in patients with D_D006930 as well as in normal subjects during experimental central sensitization. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of C_C040029, a drug effective in neuropathic D_D010146 patients, on brain processing of nociceptive information in normal and central sensitization states. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in normal volunteers, we studied the C_C040029-induced modulation of brain activity in response to nociceptive mechanical stimulation of normal skin and C_D002211-induced D_D006930. The dose of C_C040029 was 1,800 mg per os, in a single administration. We found that (i) C_C040029 reduced the activations in the bilateral operculoinsular cortex, independently of the presence of central sensitization; (ii) C_C040029 reduced the activation in the brainstem, only during central sensitization; (iii) C_C040029 suppressed stimulus-induced deactivations, only during central sensitization; this effect was more robust than the effect on brain activation. The observed drug-induced effects were not due to changes in the baseline fMRI signal. These findings indicate that C_C040029 has a measurable antinociceptive effect and a stronger antihyperalgesic effect most evident in the brain areas undergoing deactivation, thus supporting the concept that C_C040029 is more effective in modulating nociceptive transmission when central sensitization is present.

title:C_D018817 polydrug users show process-specific central executive impairments coupled with D_D003072.
abstract:In recent years working D_D008569 have been reported in users of C_D018817 (C_D018817, C_D018817). The current study aimed to assess the impact of C_D018817 use on three separate central executive processes (set shifting, inhibition and memory updating) and also on "prefrontal" mediated social and emotional judgement processes. Fifteen polydrug C_D018817 users and 15 polydrug non-C_D018817 user controls completed a general drug use questionnaire, the Brixton Spatial Anticipation task (set shifting), Backward Digit Span procedure (memory updating), Inhibition of Return (inhibition), an emotional intelligence scale, the Tromso Social Intelligence Scale and the Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DEX). Compared with C_D018817-free polydrug controls, C_D018817 polydrug users showed impairments in set shifting and memory updating, and also in social and emotional judgement processes. The latter two deficits remained significant after controlling for other drug use. These data lend further support to the proposal that cognitive processes mediated by the prefrontal cortex may be impaired by recreational C_D018817 use.

title:Severe C_C102006 D_D064420 complicating volunteer apheresis platelet donation.
abstract:We report a case of severe C_C102006 D_D064420 during volunteer donor apheresis platelet collection. The donor was a 40-year-old female, first-time apheresis platelet donor. Past medical history was remarkable for D_D006973, D_D006949, and D_D003866. Reported medications included C_D002034, C_D017035, and C_D017374. Thirty minutes from the start of the procedure, the donor noted tingling around the mouth, hands, and feet. She then very rapidly developed acute onset of severe facial and extremity D_D013746. Empirical treatment with intravenous C_D002125 was initiated, and D_C536214 slowly subsided over approximately 10 to 15 minutes. The events are consistent with a severe reaction to C_D002118 chelation by sodium C_C102006 anticoagulant resulting in symptomatic systemic D_D006996. Upon additional retrospective analysis, it was noted that C_D002034 is a C_D049994 that may cause significant D_D006996. We conclude that careful screening for medications and underlying conditions predisposing to D_D006996 is recommended to help prevent severe reactions due to C_C102006 D_D064420. Laboratory measurement of pre-procedure serum C_D002118 levels in selected donors may identify cases requiring heightened vigilance. The case also illustrates the importance of maintaining preparedness for managing rare but serious reactions in volunteer apheresis blood donors.

title:D_D011507 after conversion to C_D020123 in renal transplant recipients.
abstract:C_D020123 (C_D020123) is a new, potent immunosuppressive agent. More recently, D_D011507 has been reported as a consequence of C_D020123 therapy, although the mechanism has remained unclear. We retrospectively examined the records of 25 renal transplant patients, who developed or displayed increased D_D011507 after C_D020123 conversion. The patient cohort (14 men, 11 women) was treated with C_D020123 as conversion therapy, due to D_D051436 (D_D007674) (n = 15) D_D009369 (n = 8); D_D012514, Four D_D012878, One D_D007414, One D_D002292) or BK virus D_D007674 (n = 2). C_D020123 was started at a mean of 78 +/- 42 (15 to 163) months after transplantation. Mean follow-up on C_D020123 therapy was 20 +/- 12 (6 to 43) months. D_D011507 increased from 0.445 (0 to 1.5) g/d before conversion to 3.2 g/dL (0.2 to 12) after conversion (P = 0.001). Before conversion 8 (32%) patients had no D_D011507, whereas afterwards all patients had D_D011507. In 28% of patients D_D011507 remained unchanged, whereas it increased in 68% of patients. In 40% it increased by more than 100%. Twenty-eight percent of patients showed increased D_D011507 to the D_D009404 range. Biopsies performed in five patients revealed new pathological changes: One D_D015433 and D_D009395. These patients showed persistently good graft function. Serum C_D003404 values did not change significantly: 1.98 +/- 0.8 mg/dL before C_D020123 therapy and 2.53 +/- 1.9 mg/dL at last follow-up (P = .14). Five grafts were lost and the patients returned to dialysis. Five patients displayed D_D007674 and D_D012514. Mean urinary protein of patients who returned to dialysis was 1.26 (0.5 to 3.5) g/d before and 4.7 (3 to 12) g/d after conversion (P = .01). Mean serum C_D003404 level before conversion was 2.21 mg/dL and thereafter, 4.93 mg/dL (P = .02). Heavy D_D011507 was common after the use of C_D020123 as rescue therapy for renal transplantation. Therefore, conversion should be considered for patients who have not developed advanced D_D007674 and D_D011507. The possibility of de novo glomerular pathology under C_D020123 treatment requires further investigation by renal biopsy.

title:In vitro characterization of parasympathetic and sympathetic responses in C_D003520-induced D_D003556 in the rat.
abstract:In C_D003520-induced D_D003556 in the rat, detrusor function is impaired and the expression and effects of muscarinic receptors altered. Whether or not the neuronal transmission may be affected by D_D003556 was presently investigated. Responses of urinary strip preparations from control and C_D003520-pretreated rats to electrical field stimulation and to agonists were assessed in the absence and presence of muscarinic, adrenergic and purinergic receptor antagonists. Generally, C_D001285 reduced contractions, but in contrast to controls, it also reduced responses to low electrical field stimulation intensity (1-5 Hz) in inflamed preparations. In both types, purinoceptor desensitization with C_C002630 (C_C002630) caused further reductions at low frequencies (<10 Hz). The muscarinic receptor antagonists C_D001285, C_C042375 (C_C042375) ('M(1)/M(3)/M(5)-selective'), C_C054938 ('M(2)-selective') and C_D010890 ('M(1)-selective') antagonized the tonic component of the electrical field stimulation-evoked contractile response more potently than the phasic component. C_C042375 inhibited the tonic contractions in controls more potently than C_C054938 and C_D010890. In inflamed preparations, the muscarinic receptor antagonism on the phasic component of the electrical field stimulation-evoked contraction was decreased and the C_D010890 and C_C042375 antagonism on the tonic component was much less efficient than in controls. In contrast to controls, C_C054938 increased -- instead of decreased -- the tonic responses at high frequencies. While contractions to C_D002217 and C_D000255 were the same in inflamed and in control strips when related to a reference C_D011188 response, C_D007545-induced relaxations were smaller in inflamed strips. Thus, in D_D003556 substantial changes of the efferent functional responses occur. While postjunctional beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxations are reduced, effects by prejunctional inhibitory muscarinic receptors may be increased.

title:Associations between use of C_D001569 or related drugs and health, physical abilities and cognitive function: a non-randomised clinical study in the elderly.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: To describe associations between the use of C_D001569 or related drugs (C_D001569/RDs) and health, functional abilities and cognitive function in the elderly. METHODS: A non-randomised clinical study of patients aged > or =65 years admitted to acute hospital wards during 1 month. 164 patients (mean age +/- standard deviation [SD] 81.6 +/- 6.8 years) were admitted. Of these, nearly half (n = 78) had used C_D001569/RDs before admission, and the remainder (n = 86) were non-users. Cognitive ability was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Patients scoring > or =20 MMSE sum points were interviewed (n = 79) and questioned regarding symptoms and functional abilities during the week prior to admission. Data on use of C_D001569/RDs before admission, current medications and discharge diagnoses were collected from medical records. Health, physical abilities and cognitive function were compared between BZD/RD users and non-users, and adjustments were made for confounding variables. The residual serum concentrations of C_D010076, C_D013693 and C_C515050 were analysed. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD duration of BZD/RD use was 7 +/- 7 years (range 1-31). Two or three C_D001569/RDs were concomitantly taken by 26% of users (n = 20). Long-term use of these drugs was associated with female sex and use of a higher number of drugs with effects on the CNS, which tended to be related to diagnosed D_D003704. After adjustment for these variables as confounders, use of C_D001569/RDs was not associated with cognitive function as measured by the MMSE. However, use of C_D001569/RDs was associated with D_D004244, D_D007319 after awaking at night and D_D005221 in the mornings during the week prior to admission and with stronger D_D003866 measured at the beginning of the hospital stay. Use of C_D001569/RDs tended to be associated with a reduced ability to walk and shorter night-time sleep during the week prior to admission. A higher residual serum concentration of C_D013693 correlated with a lower MMSE sum score after adjustment for confounding variables. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term use and concomitant use of more than one BZD/RD were common in elderly patients hospitalised because of acute illnesses. Long-term use was associated with daytime and night-time symptoms indicative of poorer health and potentially caused by the adverse effects of these drugs.

title:Acute D_D014826 after acute C_D004221 intoxication.
abstract:Acute D_D010523 caused by a C_D004221 D_D062787 is very rare and there is no report of it leading to D_D014826. A 49-year-old woman was transferred to our department because of D_D011782, lancinating D_D010146, D_C580162, and D_D010292 of the distal limbs. One month previously, she had taken a single high dose of C_D004221 (130 tablets of C_D000431 STOP TAB, Shin-Poong Pharm. Co., Ansan, Korea) in a suicide attempt. She was not an alcoholic. For the first few days after ingestion, she was in a confused state and had mild to moderate D_D001259 and D_D004244. She noticed D_D006685 and distally accentuated motor and sensory dysfunction after she had recovered from this state. A nerve conduction study was consistent with severe sensorimotor axonal D_D011115. Laryngeal electromyography (thyroarytenoid muscle) showed ample denervation potentials. Laryngoscopy revealed asymmetric vocal fold movements during phonation. Her vocal change and weakness began to improve spontaneously about 3 weeks after transfer. This was a case of acute D_D010243 of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and superimposed severe acute sensorimotor axonal D_D011115 caused by high-dose C_D004221 intoxication.

title:Higher optical density of an antigen assay predicts D_D013927 in patients with C_D006493-induced D_D013921.
abstract:OBJECTIVES: To correlate optical density and percent inhibition of a two-step C_D006493-induced D_D013921 (D_D013921) antigen assay with D_D013927; the assay utilizes reaction inhibition characteristics of a high C_D006493 concentration. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with more than 50% decrease in platelet count or D_D013921 (<150 x 10(9)/L) after exposure to C_D006493, who had a positive two-step antigen assay [optical density (OD) >0.4 and >50 inhibition with high concentration of C_D006493] were included in the study. RESULTS: Forty of 94 D_D013921 patients had D_D013927 at diagnosis; 54/94 had isolated-D_D013921 without D_D013927. Eight of the isolated-D_D013921 patients developed D_D013927 within the next 30 d; thus, a total of 48 patients had D_D013927 at day 30. At diagnosis there was no significant difference in OD between D_D013921 patients with D_D013927 and those with isolated-D_D013921. However, OD was significantly higher in all patients with D_D013927 (n = 48, 1.34 +/- 0.89), including isolated-D_D013921 patients who later developed D_D013927 within 30 d (n = 8, 1.84 +/- 0.64) as compared to isolated-D_D013921 patients who did not develop D_D013927 (0.96 +/- 0.75; P = 0.011 and P = 0.008). The Receiver Operative Characteristic Curve showed that OD >1.27 in the isolated-D_D013921 group had a significantly higher chance of developing D_D013927 by day 30. None of these groups showed significant difference in percent inhibition. Multivariate analysis showed a 2.8-fold increased risk of D_D013927 in females. Similarly, D_D013927 risk increased with age and OD values. CONCLUSION: Higher OD is associated with significant risk of subsequent D_D013927 in patients with isolated-D_D013921; percent inhibition, however, was not predictive.

title:Central D_D012170 associated with C_D002996-induced ovulation.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: To report a case of central D_D012170 associated with C_D002996 citrate (C_D002996). DESIGN: Case study. SETTING: Ophthalmology clinic of an academic hospital. PATIENT(S): A 36-year-old woman referred from the D_D007247 clinic for D_D014786. INTERVENTION(S): Ophthalmic examination after C_D002996 therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Central D_D012170 after ovulation induction with C_D002996. RESULT(S): A 36-year-old Chinese woman developed central D_D012170 after eight courses of C_D002996. A search of the literature on the D_D013923 complications of C_D002996 does not include this severe ophthalmic complication, although mild D_D014786 after C_D002996 intake is not uncommon. CONCLUSION(S): This is the first reported case of central D_D012170 after treatment with C_D002996. Extra caution is warranted in treating D_D007247 patients with C_D002996, and patients should be well informed of this side effect before commencement of therapy.

title:C_D009538-induced D_D009759 correlates with midpontine activation.
abstract:The pathomechanism of C_D009538-induced D_D009759 (D_D009759) is unknown. The aim of this study was to delineate brain structures that are involved in D_D009759 generation. Eight healthy volunteers inhaled C_D009538 in darkness during a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment; eye movements were registered using video-oculography. D_D009759 correlated with blood C_D010100 level-dependent (BOLD) activity levels in a midpontine site in the posterior basis pontis. D_D009759-induced midpontine activation may correspond to activation of the dorsomedial pontine nuclei and the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, structures known to participate in the generation of multidirectional saccades and smooth pursuit eye movements.

title:Protective effect of C_D014700 on D_D006471 D_D014456 in severe D_D050197 rats.
abstract:Studies concerning with pathogenesis of D_D006471 and mucosal D_D014456ation produced in D_D050197 rats are lacking. The aim of this study is to examine the role of gastric acid back-diffusion, mast cell C_D006632 release, lipid peroxide (LPO) generation and mucosal microvascular permeability in modulating D_D006471 and D_D014456 in rats with D_D050197 induced by coadministration of C_D004872 and C_D002784. Additionally, the protective effect of C_D014700 on this D_D014456 model was evaluated. Male Wistar rats were challenged intragastrically once daily for 9 days with 1.0 ml/kg of corn oil containing C_D004872 and C_D002784 to induce D_D050197. Control rats received corn oil only. After gastric surgery, rat stomachs were irrigated for 3 h with either simulated gastric juice or normal saline. Gastric acid back-diffusion, mucosal LPO generation, C_D006632 concentration, microvascular permeability, C_D010634 hemoglobin content and D_D014456 areas were determined. Elevated D_D050197 parameters, such as serum C_D002118, total C_D002784 and low-density lipoprotein concentration were obtained in D_D050197 rats. Severe gastric D_D014456 accompanied with increased D_D014456ogenic factors, including gastric acid back-diffusion, C_D006632 release, LPO generation and C_D010634 hemoglobin content were also observed in these rats. Moreover, a positive correlation of C_D006632 to D_D006471 and to D_D014456 was found in those D_D050197 rats. This D_D006471 D_D014456 and various D_D014456ogenic parameters were dose-dependently ameliorated by daily intragastric C_D014700. D_D050197 could produce D_D006471 D_D014456 via aggravation of gastric acid back-diffusion, LPO generation, C_D006632 release and microvascular permeability that could be ameliorated by C_D014700 in rats.

title:C_D004317-induced autophagic cardiomyocyte D_D003643 plays a pathogenic role in a rat model of D_D006333.
abstract:BACC_D011188GROUND: The mechanisms underlying D_D006333 induced by C_D004317 are very complicated and still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether autophagy was involved in the progression of D_D006333 induced by C_D004317, so that we can develop a novel treatment strategy for D_D006333. METHODS: C_C025946 (C_C025946), a specific inhibitor on autophagy was used in a D_D006333 model of rats induced by C_D004317. Neonatal cardiomyocytes were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rat hearts and randomly divided into controls, an C_D004317-treated group, and a C_C025946 plus C_D004317-treated group. We then examined the morphology, expression of beclin 1 gene, mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), and Na+-C_D011188+ ATPase activity in vivo. We also assessed cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential changes and counted autophagic vacuoles in cultured cardiomyocytes. In addition, we analyzed the expression of autophagy associated gene, beclin 1 using RT-PCR and Western blotting in an animal model. RESULTS: C_C025946 significantly improved cardiac function and reduced mitochondrial injury. Furthermore, C_D004317 induced the formation of autophagic vacuoles, and C_C025946 strongly downregulated the expression of beclin 1 in C_D004317-induced failing heart and inhibited the formation of autophagic vacuoles. CONCLUSION: Autophagic cardiomyocyte D_D003643 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of D_D006333 in rats induced by C_D004317. Mitochondrial injury may be involved in the progression of D_D006333 caused by C_D004317 via the autophagy pathway.

title:D_D003221, a rather serious adverse drug reaction with C_D014635: a review of the French Pharmacovigilance database.
abstract:INTRODUCTION: D_D003221 is an adverse drug reaction frequently observed with C_D014635. Some case reports are published in the literature but no systematic study from a sample of patients has been published. We performed this study in order to describe the main characteristics of this adverse drug reaction. METHODS: Using the French Pharmacovigilance database, we selected the cases of D_D003221 reported since 1985 with C_D014635. RESULTS: 272 cases of D_D003221 were reported with C_D014635: 153 women and 119 men. D_D003221 mostly occurred during the two first weeks following C_D014635 exposure (39.7%). It was "serious" for almost 2/3 of the patients (62.5%) and its outcome favourable in most of the cases (82%). The occurrence of this ADR was more frequent in patients aged between 61 and 80 years. CONCLUSION: This work shows that D_D003221 with C_D014635 is a serious, rather frequent but reversible adverse drug reaction. It occurs especially in older patients and during the first two weeks of treatment.

title:Learning and memory deficits in C_D018817 users and their neural correlates during a face-learning task.
abstract:It has been consistently shown that C_D018817 users display impairments in learning and memory performance. In addition, working memory processing in C_D018817 users has been shown to be associated with neural alterations in hippocampal and/or cortical regions as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using functional imaging and a face-learning task, we investigated neural correlates of encoding and recalling face-name associations in 20 recreational drug users whose predominant drug use was C_D018817 and 20 controls. To address the potential confounding effects of the C_D002188 use of the C_D018817 using group, a second analysis included 14 previously tested C_D002188 users (Nestor, L., Roberts, G., Garavan, H., Hester, R., 2008. Deficits in learning and memory: parahippocampal D_D006948 and frontocortical hypoactivity in C_D002188 users. Neuroimage 40, 1328-1339). C_D018817 users performed significantly worse in learning and memory compared to controls and C_D002188 users. A conjunction analysis of the encode and recall phases of the task revealed C_D018817-specific D_D006948 in bilateral frontal regions, left temporal, right parietal, bilateral temporal, and bilateral occipital brain regions. C_D018817-specific hypoactivity was evident in the right dorsal anterior cingulated cortex (ACC) and left posterior cingulated cortex. In both C_D018817 and C_D002188 groups brain activation was decreased in the right medial frontal gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus, left dorsal cingulate gyrus, and left caudate. These results elucidated C_D018817-related deficits, only some of which might be attributed to C_D002188 use. These C_D018817-specific effects may be related to the vulnerability of isocortical and allocortical regions to the D_D020258 effects of C_D018817.

title:Prolonged elevation of plasma C_C031942 in a cardiac transplant patient with a suspected history of C_D006493-induced D_D013921 with D_D013927.
abstract:BACKGROUND: Direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) provide an alternative method of anticoagulation for patients with a history of C_D006493-induced D_D013921 (D_D013921) or D_D013921 with D_D013927 (D_D013921T) undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). In the following report, a 65-year-old D_D016638 patient with a suspected history of D_D013921T was administered C_C031942 for anticoagulation on bypass during heart transplantation. The patient required massive transfusion support (55 units of red blood cells, 42 units of fresh-frozen plasma, 40 units of cryoprecipitate, 40 units of platelets, and three doses of recombinant Factor VIIa) for severe intraoperative and postoperative bleeding. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma samples from before and after CPB were analyzed postoperatively for C_C031942 concentration using a modified ecarin clotting time (ECT) assay. RESULTS: Unexpectedly high concentrations of C_C031942 were measured in these samples (range, 0-32 microg/mL), and a prolonged plasma C_C031942 half life (t(1/2)) of 514 minutes was observed (published elimination t(1/2) is 39-51 minutes [< or = 181 minutes with D_D008107]). CONCLUSIONS: Correlation of plasma C_C031942 concentration versus the patient's coagulation variables and clinical course suggest that prolonged elevated levels of plasma C_C031942 may have contributed to the patient's extended D_D001778. Because DTIs do not have reversal agents, surgical teams and transfusion services should remain aware of the possibility of massive transfusion events during anticoagulation with these agents. This is the first report to measure plasma C_C031942 concentration in the context of CPB and extended D_D001778.

title:C_D000995 therapy-induced D_D017114: magnitude, profile, prognosis, and predictors of outcome.
abstract:C_D000995 therapy (ATT)-associated D_D017114 (ATT-D_D017114) is the commonest drug-induced D_D017114 in South Asia. Prospective studies on ATT-D_D017114 are lacking. The current study prospectively evaluated the magnitude, clinical course, outcome, and prognostic factors in ATT-D_D017114. From January 1986 to January 2009, 1223 consecutive D_D017114 patients were evaluated: ATT alone was the cause in 70 (5.7%) patients. Another 15 (1.2%) had ATT and simultaneous D_D006525. In 44 (62.8%) patients, ATT was prescribed empirically without definitive evidence of D_D014376. ATT-D_D017114 patients were younger (32.87 [+/-15.8] years), and 49 (70%) of them were women. Most had hyperacute presentation; the median D_D007565 D_D001927 interval was 4.5 (0-30) days. The median duration of ATT before D_D017114 was 30 (7-350) days. At presentation, advanced D_D001927 and D_D001929 were present in 51 (76%) and 29 (41.4%) patients, respectively. D_D006471, D_D012640, D_D007239, and D_D058186 were documented in seven (10%), five (7.1%), 26 (37.1%), and seven (10%) patients, respectively. Compared with D_D016751 virus (HEV) and non-A non-E-induced D_D017114, ATT-D_D017114 patients had nearly similar presentations except for older age and less elevation of liver enzymes. The mortality rate among patients with ATT-D_D017114 was high (67.1%, n = 47), and only 23 (32.9%) patients recovered with medical treatment. In multivariate analysis, three factors independently predicted mortality: serum C_D001663 (>or=10.8 mg/dL), prothrombin time (PT) prolongation (>or=26 seconds), and grade III/IV D_D001927 at presentation. CONCLUSION: ATT-D_D017114 constituted 5.7% of D_D017114 at our center and had a high mortality rate. Because the mortality rate is so high, determining which factors are predictors is less important. A high proportion of patients had consumed ATT empirically, which could have been prevented.

title:D_D002493 during treatment of D_D054198 in a single pediatric institution.
abstract:D_D002493 during treatment of childhood D_D054198 (D_D054198) remain a challenging clinical problem. Outcome improvement with more intensive chemotherapy has significantly increased the incidence and severity of adverse events. This study analyzed the incidence of D_D002493 during D_D054198 treatment in a single pediatric institution, focusing on clinical, radiological, and electrophysiological findings. Exclusion criteria included CNS D_D017254 at diagnosis, therapy-related D_D010523, late-onset D_D001927, or long-term D_D002493. During a 9-year period, we retrospectively collected 27 neurological events (11%) in as many patients, from 253 children enrolled in the D_D054198 front-line protocol. CNS complications included posterior reversible leukoD_D001927 syndrome (n = 10), D_D020521 (n = 5), D_D004833 (n = 2), high-dose C_D008727 D_D064420 (n = 2), syndrome of D_D007177 (n = 1), and other unclassified events (n = 7). In conclusion, CNS complications are frequent events during D_D054198 therapy, and require rapid detection and prompt treatment to limit permanent damage.

title:Effects of pallidal C_D009496 on C_D006220-induced D_D002375: behavioral and electrophysiological studies.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: The globus pallidus plays a critical role in movement regulation. Previous studies have indicated that the globus pallidus receives C_D009496ergic innervation from the striatum, and systemic administration of a C_D009496 analog could produce antiparkinsonian effects. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of pallidal C_D009496 on C_D006220-induced D_D010302. METHODS: Behavioral experiments and electrophysiological recordings were performed in the present study. RESULTS: Bilateral infusions of C_D009496 into the globus pallidus reversed C_D006220-induced D_D002375 in rats. Electrophysiological recordings showed that microinjection of C_D009496 induced excitation of pallidal neurons in the presence of systemic C_D006220 administration. The C_D009496 type-1 receptor antagonist C_C079087 blocked both the behavioral and the electrophysiological effects induced by C_D009496. CONCLUSION: Activation of pallidal C_D009496 receptors may be involved in C_D009496-induced antiparkinsonian effects.

title:Pulmonary shunt and cardiovascular responses to CPAP during C_D009599-induced D_D007022.
abstract:The effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on cardiovascular dynamics and pulmonary shunt (QS/QT) were investigated in 12 dogs before and during sodium C_D009599 infusion that decreased mean arterial blood pressure 40-50 per cent. Before C_D009599 infusion, 5 cm C_D014867 CPAP significantly, P less than .05, decreased arterial blood pressure, but did not significantly alter heart rate, cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, or QS/QT. Ten cm C_D014867 CPAP before C_D009599 infusion produced a further D_D007022 and significantly increased heart rate and D_D002303 and QS/QT. C_D009599 caused significant D_D007022 and systemic vascular resistance and increases in heart rate, but did not change cardiac output or QS/QT. Five cm C_D014867 CPAP during C_D009599 did not further alter any of the above-mentioned variables. However, 10 cm C_D014867 CPAP decreased arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, and QS/QT. These data indicate that C_D009599 infusion rates that decrease mean arterial blood pressure by 40-50 per cent do not change cardiac output or QS/QT. During C_D009599 infusion low levels of CPAP do not markedly alter cardiovascular dynamics, but high levels of CPAP (10 cm C_D014867), while decreasing QS/QT, produce marked D_D007022 and cardiac output.

title:Mediation of enhanced reflex vagal D_D001919 by C_D007980 via central C_D004298 formation in dogs.
abstract:C_D007980 (5 mg/kg i.v.) decreased blood pressure and heart rate after extracerebral decarboxylase inhibition with C_D002230 (25 mg/kg i.v.) in anesthetize C_D008995-inhibited dogs. In addition, reflex D_D001919 caused by injected C_D009638 was significantly enhanced by C_D007980, C_D015103 had no effect on blood pressure, heart rate or reflex responses to C_D009638. C_D005406, a C_D004298-beta-oxidase inhibitor, did not have any effect on the D_D007022, D_D001919 or reflex-enhancing effect of C_D007980. C_D010868 did not affect the actions of C_D007980 on blood pressure and heart rate but completely blocked the enhancement of reflexes. Removal of the carotid sinuses caused an elevation blood pressure and heart rate and abolished the negative chronotropic effect of C_D009638. However, C_D007980 restored the D_D001919 caused by C_D009638 in addition to decreasing blood pressure and heart rate. C_D006916 (5 mg/kg i.v.) decreased blood pressure and heart rate and decreased the reflex D_D001919 to C_D009638. It is concluded that C_D007980 enhances reflex D_D001919 through central alpha-receptor stimulation. Furthermore, the effects are mediated through C_D004298 rather than C_D009638 and do not require the carotid sinus baroreceptors.

title:C_D003042-induced D_D009203: clinical observations and pathogenetic considerations.
abstract:Clinical and experimental data published to date suggest several possible mechanisms by which C_D003042 may result in acute D_D009203. In individuals with preexisting, high-grade coronary arterial narrowing, acute D_D009203 may result from an increase in myocardial C_D010100 demand associated with C_D003042-induced increase in rate-pressure product. In other individuals with no underlying D_D050197, D_D054059 may be due to D_D013035, D_D013927, or both. With regard to D_D013035, the clinical findings are largely circumstantial, and the locus of C_D003042-induced vasoconstriction remains speculative. Although certain clinical and experimental findings support the hypothesis that D_D013035 involves the epicardial, medium-size vessels, other data suggest intramural vasoconstriction. Diffuse intramural vasoconstriction is not consistent with reports of segmental, discrete D_D007238. Whereas certain in vivo data suggest that these effects are alpha-mediated, other in vitro data suggest the opposite. The finding of C_D003042-induced vasoconstriction in segments of (noninnervated) human umbilical artery suggests that the presence or absence of intact innervation is not sufficient to explain the discrepant data involving the possibility of alpha-mediated effects. Finally, the contribution of a primary, D_D013927 effect of C_D003042 has not been excluded.

title:Acute bronchodilating effects of C_D009241 and C_D013806 in D_D029424.
abstract:The bronchodilator effects of a single dose of C_D009241 aerosol (36 micrograms) and short-acting C_D013806 tablets (dose titrated to produce serum levels of 10-20 micrograms/mL) were compared in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in 21 patients with stable, D_D029424. Mean peak forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) increases over baseline and the proportion of patients attaining at least a 15% increase in the FEV1 (responders) were 31% and 90%, respectively, for C_D009241 and 17% and 50%, respectively, for C_D013806. The average FEV1 increases during the 6-hour observation period were 18% for C_D009241 and 8% for C_D013806. The mean duration of action was 3.8 hours with C_D009241 and 2.4 hours with C_D013806. While side effects were rare, those experienced after C_D013806 use did involve the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems. These results show that C_D009241 is a more potent bronchodilator than oral C_D013806 in patients with D_D029424.

title:Irreversible damage to the medullary interstitium in experimental analgesic D_D007674 in F344 rats.
abstract:D_D007681 (D_D007681) and a decreased urinary concentrating ability developed during continuous long-term treatment with C_D001241 and C_D000082 in female Fischer 344 rats. Renal structure and concentrating ability were examined after a recovery period of up to 18 weeks, when no analgesics were given, to investigate whether the analgesic-induced changes were reversible. There was no evidence of repair to the damaged medullary interstitial matrix, or proliferation of remaining undamaged type 1 medullary interstitial cells after the recovery period following analgesic treatment. The recovery of urinary concentrating ability was related to the length of analgesic treatment and the extent of the resulting inner medullary structural damage. During the early stages of analgesic treatment, the changes in urinary concentrating ability were reversible, but after prolonged analgesic treatment, maximum urinary concentrating ability failed to recover. This study shows that prolonged analgesic treatment in Fischer 344 rats causes progressive and irreversible damage to the interstitial matrix and type 1 interstitial cells leading to D_D007681. The associated urinary concentrating defect is reversible only during the early stages of structural damage to the inner medulla.

title:Less frequent C_D008094 administration and lower urine volume.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine whether patients maintained on a regimen of C_D008094 on a once-per-day schedule have lower urine volumes than do patients receiving multiple doses per day. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study of 85 patients from a C_D008094 clinic who received different dose schedules. Patients were admitted to the hospital for measurement of C_D008094 level, C_D003404 clearance, urine volume, and maximum osmolality. RESULTS: Multiple daily doses of C_D008094 were associated with higher urine volumes. The dosing schedule, duration of C_D008094 treatment, and daily dose of C_D008094 did not affect maximum osmolality or C_D003404 clearance. CONCLUSIONS: Urine volume can be reduced by giving C_D008094 once daily and/or by lowering the total daily dose. C_D008094-induced D_D011141 seems to be related to extrarenal as well as to renal effects.

title:Effect of C_D004317 combined with whole body D_D005334 on D_D009369 and normal tissues.
abstract:Thermal enhancement of C_D004317-mediated antiD_D009369 activity and normal tissue D_D064420 by whole body D_D005334 were compared using a F344 rat model. AntiD_D009369 activity was studied using a D_D009369 growth delay assay. Acute normal tissue D_D064420 (i.e., D_D007970 and D_D013921) and late normal tissue D_D064420 (i.e., myocardial and kidney injury) were evaluated by functional/physiological assays and by morphological techniques. Whole body D_D005334 (120 min at 41.5 degrees C) enhanced both C_D004317-mediated antiD_D009369 activity and toxic side effects. The thermal enhancement ratio calculated for antiD_D009369 activity was 1.6. Thermal enhancement ratios estimated for "acute" hematological changes were 1.3, whereas those estimated for "late" damage (based on morphological cardiac and renal lesions) varied between 2.4 and 4.3. Thus, while whole body D_D005334 enhances C_D004317-mediated antiD_D009369 effect, normal tissue D_D064420 is also increased, and the potential therapeutic gain of the combined modality treatment is eroded.

title:C_D011224-induced D_D014550.
abstract:A case of genuine D_D014550 due to C_D011224, a common antihypertensive drug, is presented. C_D011224 exerts its antihypertensive effects through vasodilatation caused by selective blockade of postsynaptic alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. As an alpha-blocker, it also exerts a significant relaxant effect on the bladder neck and urethra. The patient's clinical course is described and correlated with initial urodynamic studies while on C_D011224 and subsequent studies while taking C_D014700. Her D_D014549 resolved with the change of medication. The restoration of continence was accompanied by a substantial rise in maximum urethral pressure, maximum urethral closure pressure, and functional urethral length. Patients who present with D_D014550 while taking C_D011224 should change their antihypertensive medication before considering surgery, because their D_D014549 may resolve spontaneously with a change in drug therapy.

title:C_D005473-induced D_D017109: clinical and theoretical implications.
abstract:Five patients receiving C_D005473 for the treatment of D_D009771 or D_D003865 developed D_D017109. The typical C_D005473-induced symptoms of restlessness, constant pacing, purposeless movements of the feet and legs, and marked D_D001008 were indistinguishable from those of neuroleptic-induced D_D017109. Three patients who had experienced neuroleptic-induced D_D017109 in the past reported that the symptoms of C_D005473-induced D_D017109 were identical, although somewhat milder. D_D017109 appeared to be a common side effect of C_D005473 and generally responded well to treatment with the beta-adrenergic antagonist C_D011433, dose reduction, or both. The authors suggest that C_D005473-induced D_D017109 may be caused by serotonergically mediated inhibition of dopaminergic neurotransmission and that the pathophysiology of C_D005473-induced D_D017109 and tricyclic C_D000928-induced "jitteriness" may be identical.

abstract:We describe eight patients in whom C_D003042 use was related to D_D020521 and review 39 cases from the literature. Among these 47 patients the mean (+/- SD) age was 32.5 +/- 12.1 years; 76% (34/45) were men. D_D020521 followed C_D003042 use by inhalation, intranasal, intravenous, and intramuscular routes. D_D002532 or D_D001165 were present in 17 of 32 patients studied angiographically or at autopsy; D_D020293 was present in two patients. D_D002544 occurred in 10 patients (22%), D_D002543 in 22 (49%), and D_D013345 in 13 (29%). These data indicate that (1) the apparent incidence of D_D020521 related to C_D003042 use is increasing; (2) C_D003042-associated D_D020521 occurs primarily in young adults; (3) D_D020521 may follow any route of C_D003042 administration; (4) D_D020521 after C_D003042 use is frequently associated with D_D002532 and D_D001165; and (5) in C_D003042-associated D_D020521, the frequency of D_D020300 exceeds that of D_D002544.

Two patients with D_D003924 developed an acute D_D056486-like syndrome soon after initiation of C_D005905 therapy. There was no serologic evidence of D_D014777, and a liver biopsy sample showed a histologic pattern consistent with drug-induced D_D056486. Both patients recovered quickly after stopping C_D005905 therapy and have remained well for a follow-up period of 1 year. C_D005905 can produce an acute D_D056486-like illness in some persons.

title:Systolic pressure variation is greater during D_D006470 than during C_D009599-induced D_D007022 in ventilated dogs.
abstract:The systolic pressure variation (SPV), which is the difference between the maximal and minimal values of the systolic blood pressure (SBP) after one positive-pressure breath, was studied in ventilated dogs subjected to D_D007022. Mean arterial pressure was decreased to 50 mm Hg for 30 minutes either by D_D006470 (D_D006470, n = 7) or by continuous infusion of C_D009599 (C_D009599, n = 7). During D_D006470-induced D_D007022 the cardiac output was significantly lower and systemic vascular resistance higher compared with that in the C_D009599 group. The systemic, central venous, pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and heart rates, were similar in the two groups. Analysis of the respiratory changes in the arterial pressure waveform enabled differentiation between the two groups. The SPV during D_D007022 was 15.7 +/- 6.7 mm Hg in the D_D006470 group, compared with 9.1 +/- 2.0 mm Hg in the C_D009599 group (P less than 0.02). The delta down, which is the measure of decrease of SBP after a mechanical breath, was 20.3 +/- 8.4 and 10.1 +/- 3.8 mm Hg in the D_D006470 and C_D009599 groups, respectively, during D_D007022 (P less than 0.02). It is concluded that increases in the SPV and the delta down are characteristic of a D_D007022 state due to a predominant decrease in preload. They are thus more important during absolute D_D020896 than during deliberate D_D007022.

Flow and metabolism were measured 5-13 days after the D_D013345 by a modification of the classical Kety-Schmidt technique using C_D014978-133 i.v. Anaesthesia was maintained with an inspired C_D007530 concentration of 0.75% (plus 67% C_D009609 in C_D010100), during which CBF and CMRO2 were 34.3 +/- 2.1 ml/100 g min-1 and 2.32 +/- 0.16 ml/100 g min-1 at PaCO2 4.1 +/- 0.1 kPa (mean +/- SEM). Controlled D_D007022 to an average MAP of 50-55 mm C_D008628 was induced by increasing the dose of C_D007530, and maintained at an inspired concentration of 2.2 +/- 0.2%. This resulted in a significant decrease in CMRO2 (to 1.73 +/- 0.16 ml/100 g min-1), while CBF was unchanged. After the clipping of the D_D000783 the C_D007530 concentration was reduced to 0.75%. There was a significant increase in CBF, although CMRO2 was unchanged, compared with pre-D_D007022 values. These changes might offer protection to brain tissue during periods of induced D_D007022.

In each group, C_D009599 infusion resulted in an initial decrease in blood pressure from 86 torr and 83 torr, respectively, to 48 torr. During the C_D009599 infusion the control animals demonstrated a progressive D_D006973 to 61 torr, whereas the C_D012504-treated animals showed no change. Following discontinuation of C_D009599, blood pressure in the control animals rebounded to 94 torr, as compared with 78 torr in the C_D012504-treated rats. This study indicates that with stable C_D006221 anesthesia, the partial recovery of blood pressure during C_D009599 infusion and the post-C_D009599 rebound of blood pressure can be completely blocked by C_D012504. This demonstrates the participation of the renin--C_D000809 system in antagonizing the combined D_D007022 effects of C_D006221 and C_D009599.

title:D_D056486 induced by antithyroid drugs: four cases including one with cross-reactivity between C_D002231 and C_C019269.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to assess the occurrence of D_D056486 encountered with antithyroid drugs. METHODS: Retrospective review of medical records of 236 patients with D_D006980 admitted in our department (in- or out-patients) from 1986 to 1992. RESULTS: Four patients (1.7%) were identified with D_D056486 which could reasonably be attributed to the use of antithyroid agent. Two patients had a D_D002779 D_D056486 induced by C_D002231 (C_D002231). Two others had a mixed (D_D002779 and cytolytic) D_D056486 following C_D002231. One of the latter two patients further experienced a cytolytic D_D056486 which appeared after C_C019269 (C_C019269) had replaced C_D002231. Biological features of D_D056486 disappeared in all cases after cessation of the incriminated drug, while biliary, viral and immunological searches were negative. Only 2 patients of our retrospective study experienced a mild or severe D_D009503. CONCLUSION: D_D056486 is a potential adverse effect of antithyroid drugs which warrants, as for haematological disturbances, a pre-therapeutic determination and a careful follow-up of relevant biological markers. Moreover, D_D056486 may not be restricted to one class of antithyroid agents.

title:Study of the role of C_D014805 and C_D002955 supplementation in preventing hematologic D_D064420 of C_D015215.
abstract:A prospective, randomized study was conducted to evaluate the role of C_D014805 and C_D002955 supplementation in preventing C_D015215 (C_D015215)-induced D_D001855. Seventy-five D_D015658 patients with CD4+ cell counts < 500/mm3 were randomized to receive either C_D015215 (500 mg daily) alone (group I, n = 38) or in combination with C_D002955 (15 mg daily) and intramascular C_D014805 (1000 micrograms monthly) (group II, n = 37). Finally, 15 patients were excluded from the study (noncompliance 14, D_D003643 1); thus, 60 patients (31 in group I and 29 in group II) were eligible for analysis. No significant differences between groups were found at enrollment. During the study, C_D014805 and C_D005492 levels were significantly higher in group II patients; however, no differences in hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, and white-cell, neutrophil and platelet counts were observed between groups at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Severe hematologic D_D064420 (neutrophil count < 1000/mm3 and/or hemoglobin < 8 g/dl) occurred in 4 patients assigned to group I and 7 assigned to group II. There was no correlation between C_D014805 or C_D005492 levels and development of D_D001855. C_D014805 and C_D002955 supplementation of C_D015215 therapy does not seem useful in preventing or reducing C_D015215-induced myeloD_D064420 in the overall treated population, although a beneficial effect in certain subgroups of patients cannot be excluded.

title:Acute D_D003221 induced by a high-dose infusion of C_D005472 and C_D002955.
abstract:A 61-year-old man was treated with combination chemotherapy incorporating C_D002945, C_D005047, high-dose C_D005472 (2,250 mg/m2/24 hours) and C_D002955 for an inoperable D_D013274. He developed acute neurologic symptoms of mental D_D003221, D_D003221 and D_D001523, and then lapsed into a deep D_D003128, lasting for approximately 40 hours during the first dose (day 2) of C_D005472 and C_D002955 infusion. This complication reappeared on day 25 during the second dose of C_D005472 and C_D002955, which were then the only drugs given. Because C_D002955 was unlikely to be associated with this condition, D_D020258 due to high-dose C_D005472 was highly suspected. The pathogenesis of C_D005472 D_D020258 may be due to a Krebs cycle blockade by C_D005463 and C_C007744, C_D013831 deficiency, or C_C007419 dehydrogenase deficiency. High-dose C_D005472/C_D002955 infusion therapy has recently become a popular regimen for various D_D009369. It is necessary that both oncologists and neurologists be fully aware of this unusual complication.

title:Effect of switching C_D002220 to C_C036006 on the plasma levels of neuroleptics. A case report.
abstract:C_D002220 was switched to its 10-keto analogue C_C036006 among six difficult-to-treat D_D012559 or D_D019965 patients using concomitantly C_D006220, C_D002746 or C_D003024. This change resulted within 2-4 weeks in the 50-200% increase in the plasma levels of these neuroleptics and the appearance of D_D001480. None of the patients showed any clinical deteriotation during the following 3-6 months. The results of this case report support the idea that in contrast with C_D002220 C_C036006 does not induce the hepatic microsomal enzyme systems regulating the inactivation of antipsychotic drugs.

title:D_D004892 and D_D009205 caused by C_D000667.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: To report a case of D_D004892 and D_D009205 caused by C_D000667. CASE SUMMARY: A 13-year-old boy was treated with C_D000667 and C_D005839 because of suspected D_D018805. Medications were discontinued when D_D004892 and D_D006333 caused by D_D009205 occurred. The patient was treated with C_D008775 and gradually improved. Macrophage-migration inhibition (MIF) test with C_D000667 was positive. DISCUSSION: After most D_D007239 causing D_D004892 and D_D009205 were ruled out, a D_D004342 was suspected. Positive MIF test for C_D000667 showed sensitization of the patient's lymphocytes to C_D000667. CONCLUSIONS: Hypersensitivity D_D009205 is a rare and dangerous manifestation of D_D004342 to C_D010406.

title:Immediate D_D004342 to C_D000658.
abstract:A large group of patients with suspected D_D004342 to C_D047090 antibiotics was evaluated. A detailed clinical history, together with skin tests, RAST (radioallergosorbent test), and controlled challenge tests, was used to establish whether patients D_D004342 to C_D047090 antibiotics had selective immediate D_D004342 responses to C_D000658 (C_D000658) or were cross-reacting with other C_D010406 derivatives. Skin tests were performed with C_-1 (C_-1), C_-1, benzylC_D010406 (C_D010400), C_D000667 (C_D000667), and C_D000658. RAST for C_-1 and C_D000658-PLL was done. When both skin test and RAST for C_-1 were negative, single-blind, placebo-controlled challenge tests were done to ensure tolerance of C_D010400 or sensitivity to C_D000658. A total of 177 patients were diagnosed as D_D004342 to C_D047090 antibiotics. We selected the 54 (30.5%) cases of immediate C_D000658 D_D004342 with good tolerance of C_D010400. D_D000707 was seen in 37 patients (69%), the other 17 (31%) having D_D014581 and/or D_D000799. All the patients were skin test negative to C_-1; 49 of 51 (96%) were also negative to D_D007645, and 44 of 46 (96%) to C_D010400. Skin tests with C_D000658 were positive in 34 (63%) patients. RAST was positive for C_D000658 in 22 patients (41%) and to C_-1 in just 5 (9%). None of the sera with negative RAST for C_D000658 were positive to C_-1. Challenge tests with C_D000658 were performed in 23 subjects (43%) to establish the diagnosis of immediate D_D004342 reaction to C_D000658, and in 15 cases (28%) both skin test and RAST for C_D000658 were negative. C_D010400 was well tolerated by all 54 patients. We describe the largest group of C_D000658-D_D004342 patients who have tolerated C_D010400 reported so far. Diagnosis of these patients can be achieved only if specific C_D000658-related reagents are employed. Further studies are necessary to determine the exact extent of this problem and to improve the efficacy of diagnostic methods.

title:Persistent D_D010243 after prolonged use of C_D001279 in the absence of corticosteroids.
abstract:Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) are often used for patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. Reports of persistent D_D010243 after the discontinuance of these drugs have most often involved aminosteroid-based NMBAs such as C_D014673, especially when used in conjunction with corticosteroids. C_D001279, a short-acting C_-1 NMBA that is eliminated independently of renal or hepatic function, has also been associated with persistent D_D010243, but only when used with corticosteroids. We report a case of C_D001279-related D_D010243 persisting for approximately 50 hours in a patient who was not treated with corticosteroids.

title:Habitual use of C_D000082 as a risk factor for D_D007676: a comparison with C_D010615.
abstract:Six epidemiologic studies in the United States and Europe indicate that habitual use of C_D010615 is associated with the development of D_D007676 and D_D007676 (D_D007676), with a relative risk in the range of 4 to 19. As a result of these and other studies, C_D010615 has now been withdrawn from the market in most countries. However, three case control studies, one each in North Carolina, northern Maryland, and West Berlin, Germany, showed that habitual use of C_D000082 is also associated with D_D007676 and D_D007676, with a relative risk in the range of 2 to 4. These studies suggest that both C_D010615 and C_D000082 may contribute to the burden of D_D007676, with the risk of the latter being somewhat less than that of the former. This apparent difference in risk may not be due to differences in D_D007674 potential of the drugs themselves. A lower relative risk would be expected for C_D000082 if the risk of both drugs in combination with other analgesics was higher than the risk of either agent alone. Thus, C_D000082 has been used both as a single agent and in combination with other analgesics, whereas C_D010615 was available only in combinations. The possibility that habitual use of C_D000082 alone increases the risk of D_D007676 has not been clearly demonstrated, but cannot be dismissed.

title:Reduction of C_D006497-associated anionic sites in the glomerular basement membrane of rats with C_D013311-induced D_D003928.
abstract:C_D006497-associated anionic sites in the glomerular basement membrane were studied in rats 8 months after induction of D_D003920 by C_D013311 and in age- adn sex-matched control rats, employing the cationic dye C_C015445. Morphometric analysis at the ultrastructural level was performed using a computerized image processor. The C_D006497 specificity of the C_C015445 staining was demonstrated by C_D006025-degrading enzymes, showing that pretreatment of the sections with heparitinase abolished all staining, whereas chondroitinase ABC had no effect. The majority of anionic sites (74% in D_D003920 and 81% in control rats) were found within the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane. A minority of anionic sites were scattered throughout the lamina densa and lamina rara interna, and were significantly smaller than those in the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane (p<0.001 and p<0.01 for D_D003920 and control rats, respectively). D_D003920 rats progressively developed D_D000419 reaching 40.3 (32.2-62.0) mg/24 h after 8 months in contrast to the control animals (0.8 (0.2-0.9) mg/24 h, p<0.002). At the same time, the number of C_D006497 anionic sites and the total anionic site surface (number of anionic sites x mean anionic site surface) in the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane was reduced by 19% (p<0.021) and by 26% (p<0.02), respectively. Number and total anionic site surface in the remaining part of the glomerular basement membrane (lamina densa and lamina rara interna) were not significantly changed. We conclude that in C_D013311-D_D003920 rats with an increased urinary albumin excretion, a reduced C_D006497 charge barrier/density is found at the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane.

title:Effect of some anticancer drugs and combined chemotherapy on D_D007674.
abstract:The D_D007674 action of anticancer drugs such as C_D008466 (C_D008466), C_D008727 (C_D008727), C_D005472 (C_D005472) and C_D003520 (C_D003520) administered alone or in combination [C_D008727 + C_D005472 + C_D003520 (CMF)] was evaluated in experiments on Wistar rats. After drug administration, C_D003404 concentrations in the plasma and in the urine of the rats were determined, as well as C_D003404 clearance. Histopathologic evaluation of the kidneys was also performed. After C_D008727 administration a significant increase (p = 0.0228) in the plasma C_D003404 concentration and a significant (p = 0.0001) decrease in C_D003404 clearance was noted compared to controls. After the administration of C_D008466, C_D005472 and C_D003520 neither a statistically significant increase in C_D003404 concentration nor an increase in C_D003404 clearance was observed compared to the group receiving no cytostatics. Following polytherapy according to the CMF regimen, a statistically significant decrease (p = 0.0343) in C_D003404 clearance was found, but C_D003404 concentration did not increase significantly compared to controls. C_D003520 caused hemorrhagic cystitis in 40% of rats, but it did not cause this complication when combined with C_D005472 and C_D008727. Histologic changes were found in rat kidneys after administration of C_D008727, C_D003520 and C_D008466, while no such change was observed after C_D005472 and joint administration of C_D008727 + C_D005472 + C_D003520 compared to controls. Our studies indicate that D_D007674ity of C_D008727 + C_D005472 + C_D003520 administered jointly is lower than in monotherapy.

title:C_D008094-associated D_D003072 reduced by a switch to C_D014635: a case series.
abstract:BACKGROUND: C_D008094 remains a first-line treatment for the acute and maintenance treatment of D_D001714. Although much has been written about the management of the more common adverse effects of C_D008094, such as D_D011141 and D_D014202, more subtle C_D008094 side effects such as D_D003072, D_D003072, and D_D003072 remain understudied. This report summarizes our experience in switching D_D001714 patients from C_D008094 to C_D014635 to alleviate such cognitive and D_D003072. METHOD: Open, case series design. RESULTS: We report seven cases where substitution of C_D008094, either fully or partially, with C_D014635 was extremely helpful in reducing the D_D003072 attributed to C_D008094 in our D_D001714 patients. CONCLUSION: In this preliminary report, C_D014635 was a superior alternative to C_D008094 in D_D001714 patients experiencing D_D003072, D_D003072, and D_D003072.

title:Treatment of previously treated metastatic D_D001943 by C_D008942 and 48-hour continuous infusion of high-dose C_D005472 and C_D002955 (C_C085788): low palliative benefit and high treatment-related D_D064420.
abstract:For previously treated advanced D_D001943, there is no standard second-line therapy. Combination chemotherapy with C_D008942, high-dose C_D005472 (C_D005472) and C_D002955 (C_C085788 regimen) had been reported as an effective and well tolerated regimen. From October 1993 to November 1995, we treated 13 patients with previously chemotherapy-treated metastatic D_D001943 by C_D008942, 12 mg/m2, on day 1 and continuous infusion of C_D005472, 3000 mg/m2, together with C_D002955, 300 mg/m2, for 48 h from day 1 to 2. Each course of chemotherapy was given every 4 weeks. Most of these patients had more than two metastatic sites, with lung metastasis predominant. Seven patients had been treated with C_D018943. Seven patients had previously received radiotherapy and seven had received hormone therapy. Median number of courses of C_C085788 regimen given was six and the median cumulative dose of C_D008942 was 68.35 mg/m2. One patient had complete response, seven had stable disease, none had partial response and five had progressive disease. The overall objective response rate was 7.6%. The median follow-up period was 14 months. Median survival was 16 months. Median progression-free survival was 5 months. A complete responder had relapse-free survival up to 17 months. Major D_D064420 were cardioD_D064420 and D_D007970. Eight patients were dead in the last follow-up; two of them died of treatment-related D_D064420. The C_C085788 regimen achieves little palliative benefit and induces severe D_D064420 at a fairly high rate. Administration of this regimen to D_D001943 patients who have been treated by chemotherapy and those with D_D006331 requires careful attention.

title:Upregulation of the expression of C_D014667 gene in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the C_D008094-induced D_D003919 rat.
abstract:The expression of arginine C_D014667 (C_D001127) gene in the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic nuclei (SON) was investigated in rats with C_D008094 (C_D008094)-induced D_D011141, using in situ hybridization histochemistry and radioimmunoassay. The male Wistar rats consuming a diet that contained C_D008094Cl (60 mmol/kg) for 4 weeks developed marked D_D011141. The C_D008094-treated rats produced a large volume of hypotonic urine with low ionic concentrations. Plasma C_D012964 concentrations were found to be slightly increased in the C_D008094-treated rats compared with those in controls. Plasma concentration of C_D001127 and transcripts of C_D001127 gene in the PVN and SON were significantly increased in the C_D008094-treated rats compared with controls. These results suggest that D_D003681 and/or the activation of visceral afferent inputs may contribute to the elevation of plasma C_D001127 and the upregulation of C_D001127 gene expression in the PVN and the SON of the C_D008094-induced D_D003919 rat.

title:C_D013390-induced D_D006323 and D_D003643 following 5 days of immobilization.
abstract:The present report describes a case of D_D006323 and subsequent D_D003643 as a result of D_D006947 following the use of C_D013390 in a 23-year-old Malawian woman. Five days after the onset of the symptoms of D_D008581, the patient aspirated stomach contents and needed endotracheal intubation. Forty seconds after injection of C_D013390, D_D001919 and D_D006323 occurred. Attempts to resuscitate the patient were not successful. The serum level of C_D011188 was observed to be 8.4 mequiv L-1. Apart from the reduction in the patient's level of consciousness, there were no signs of motor neurone damage or of any of the other known predisposing conditions for D_D006947 following the administration of C_D013390. It is postulated that her D_D003643 was caused by D_D004342 to C_D013390, associated with her 5-day immobilization.

title:An unusual toxic reaction to axillary block by C_D008619 with C_D004837.
abstract:An D_D006973, accompanied by D_D001281, D_D011595, D_D019954 and D_D014474, was observed in an elderly, ASA classification group II, cardiovascularly medicated male, 12 min after performance of axillary block with C_D008619 850 mg containing C_D004837 0.225 mg, for correction of D_D004387. After intravenous administration of C_D007741, C_D008790 and C_D008874 the patient's condition improved, and 15 min later he woke up. The block was successful and surgery was conducted as scheduled despite persisting D_D001281. Postoperatively, the patient refused DC cardioversion and was treated medically. Both the temporal relationship of events and the response to treatment suggest that a rapid systemic absorption of C_D008619 with C_D004837 and/or interaction of these drugs with the patient's cardiovascular medications were responsible for the perioperative complications.

title:Clinical and histopathologic examination of renal allografts treated with C_D016559 (C_D016559) for at least one year.
abstract:BACKGROUND: We clinically and pathologically analyzed renal allografts from 1 9 renal transplant patients treated with C_D016559 (C_D016559) for more than 1 year. METHODS: Twenty-six renal allograft biopsy specimens from 1 9 renal transplant patients who underwent transplantations between 1991 and 1993 were evaluated. Thirteen biopsies were performed from stable functioning renal allografts with informed consent (nonepisode biopsy) and the other 13 were from dysfunctional renal allografts with a clinical indication for biopsy (episode biopsy). RESULTS: The main pathologic diagnoses (some overlap) were acute rejection (AR; n = 4), chronic rejection (CR; n=5), AR+CR (n =4), recurrent D_D005922 (n =5), normal findings (n =2), minimal-type chronic C_D016559 D_D007674 (n = 9), and mild-type C_D016559 D_D007674 (n = 11). Of the nonepisode biopsies, 7 and 4 biopsies showed minimal-type and mild-type chronic C_D016559 D_D007674, respectively. Chronic C_D016559 D_D007674 consisted of rough and foamy tubular vacuolization (5 biopsies), arteriolopathy (angiodegeneration of the arteriolar wall; 20 biopsies), D_D005923 (4 biopsies) and the striped form of D_D005355 (11 biopsies). The serum C_D003404 levels of patients in the mild-type chronic C_D016559 D_D007674 group, which included 7 episode biopsies, were statistically higher than those in the minimum-type chronic C_D016559-D_D007674 group (P< 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that chronic C_D016559 D_D007674 consists primarily of arteriolopathy manifesting as insudative hyalinosis of the arteriolar wall, and suggests that mild-type chronic C_D016559 D_D007674 is a condition which may lead to deterioration of renal allograft function.

title:Memory facilitation and stimulation of endogenous nerve growth factor synthesis by the C_D000109 releaser C_C087567.
abstract:The effects of C_C087567 (C_C087567), the C_D000109 releaser, on memory processes and nerve growth factor (NGF) synthesis were evaluated. In the mouse passive-avoidance test, C_C087567 (10-30 mg/kg, i.p.), administered 20 min before the training session, prevented D_D000647 induced by both the non selective antimuscarinic drug C_D012601 and the M1-selective antagonist C_C098725. In the same experimental conditions, C_C087567 (5-20 microg per mouse, i.c.v.) was also able to prevent antimuscarine-induced D_D000647, demonstrating a central localization of the activity. At the highest effective doses, C_C087567 did not produce any collateral symptoms as revealed by the Irwin test, and it did not modify spontaneous motility and inspection activity, as revealed by the hole-board test. C_C087567 was also able to increase the amount of NGF secreted in vitro by astrocytes in a dose-dependent manner. The maximal NGF contents obtained by C_C087567 were 17.6-fold of the control value. During culture, no morphological changes were found at effective concentrations of C_C087567. The current work indicates the ability of C_C087567 to induce beneficial effects on cognitive processes and stimulate activity of NGF synthesis in astroglial cells. Therefore, C_C087567 could represent a potential useful drug able to improve the function of impaired cognitive processes.

title:Recurarization in the recovery room.
abstract:A case of recurarization in the recovery room is reported. Accumulation of C_D001279 in the intravenous line led to recurarization after flushing the line in the recovery room. A D_D012131 with severe D_D001049 and D_D001919 occurred. Circumstances leading to this event and the mechanisms enabling a D_D020879 to occur, following the administration of a small dose of relaxant, are discussed.

title:Recurrent use of newer C_D003276 and the risk of D_D054556.
abstract:The epidemiological studies that assessed the risk of D_D054556 (D_D054556) associated with newer C_D003276 (C_D003276) did not distinguish between patterns of C_D003276 use, namely first-time users, repeaters and switchers. Data from a Transnational case-control study were used to assess the risk of D_D054556 for the latter patterns of use, while accounting for duration of use. Over the period 1993-1996, 551 cases of D_D054556 were identified in Germany and the UK along with 2066 controls. Totals of 128 cases and 650 controls were analysed for repeat use and 135 cases and 622 controls for switching patterns. The adjusted rate ratio of D_D054556 for repeat users of third generation C_D003276 was 0.6 (95% CI:0.3-1.2) relative to repeat users of second generation pills, whereas it was 1.3 (95% CI:0.7-2.4) for switchers from second to third generation pills relative to switchers from third to second generation pills. We conclude that second and third generation agents are associated with equivalent risks of D_D054556 when the same agent is used repeatedly after interruption periods or when users are switched between the two generations of pills. These analyses suggest that the higher risk observed for the newer C_D003276 in other studies may be the result of inadequate comparisons of pill users with different patterns of pill use.

title:Development of C_D001058-induced D_D010554: comparison of adult male and female Wistar rats.
abstract:The development of C_D001058-induced (1.0 mg/kg s.c. once daily) D_D010554 of adult male and female Wistar rats obtained from the same breeder was studied in two consecutive sets. In male animals, repeated C_D001058 treatment induced a gradual development of D_D010554 as evidenced by the increased intensity of D_D010554 and shortened latency before the first attack toward the opponent. In female rats, only a weak tendency toward D_D010554 was found. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates gender differences in the development of the C_D001058-induced D_D010554 and indicates that the female rats do not fill the validation criteria for use in this method.

title:C_D018490 and D_D014549.
abstract:Many new C_D018490 have been introduced over the past decade. Although D_D014549 is listed as one side effect of these drugs in their package inserts there is only one report in the literature. This concerns 2 male patients who experienced D_D014549 while taking C_C047426. In the present paper the authors describe 2 female patients who developed D_D014549 secondary to the selective C_D012701 reuptake inhibitors C_D017374 and C_D020280, as well as a third who developed this side effect on C_C047426. In 2 of the 3 cases the patients were also taking C_D016651 and beta-blockers, both of which could have contributed to the D_D014549. Animal studies suggest that D_D014549 secondary to C_D018490 could be mediated by the 5HT4 receptors found on the bladder. Further research is needed to delineate the frequency of this troubling side effect and how best to treat it.

title:D_D007022 following the initiation of C_C023754 in a patient treated with an C_D000809 converting enzyme inhibitor for chronic D_D006973.
abstract:Centrally acting alpha-2 adrenergic agonists are one of several pharmacologic agents used in the treatment of D_D009128 related to D_D002493. In addition to their effects on D_D009128, certain adverse cardiorespiratory effects have been reported. Adults chronically treated with C_D000809 converting enzyme inhibitors may have a limited ability to respond to D_D007022 when the sympathetic response is simultaneously blocked. The authors present a 10-year-old boy chronically treated with C_D017706, an C_D000809 converting enzyme inhibitor, to control D_D006973 who developed D_D007022 following the addition of C_C023754, an alpha-2 agonist, for the treatment of D_D009128. The possible interaction of C_C023754 and other antihypertensive agents should be kept in mind when prescribing therapy to treat either D_D006973 or D_D009128 in such patients.

title:Peritubular capillary basement membrane reduplication in allografts and native D_D007674: a clinicopathologic study of 278 consecutive renal specimens.
abstract:BACKGROUND: An association has been found between D_D007674 (D_D007674) and reduplication of peritubular capillary basement membranes (PTCR). Although such an association is of practical and theoretical importance, only one prospective study has tried to confirm it. METHODS: We examined 278 consecutive renal specimens (from 135 transplants and 143 native kidneys) for ultrastructural evidence of PTCR. In addition to renal allografts with D_D007674, we also examined grafts with acute rejection, recurrent D_D005921, D_D051436 and stable grafts ("protocol biopsies"). Native kidney specimens included a wide range of D_D007674 as well as cases of D_D057049, D_D006974, acute D_D009395, and D_D007683. RESULTS: We found PTCR in 14 of 15 cases of D_D007674, in 7 transplant biopsy specimens without D_D007674, and in 13 of 143 native kidney biopsy specimens. These 13 included cases of D_D006974, D_D057049, D_D008181, D_D011695, crescentic D_D005921, and C_D003042-related D_D058186. Mild PTCR in allografts without D_D007674 did not predict D_D051437 or significant D_D011507 after follow-up periods of between 3 months and 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that in transplants, there is a strong association between well-developed PTCR and D_D007674, while the significance of mild PTCR and its predictive value in the absence of D_D007674 is unclear. PTCR also occurs in certain native D_D007674s, though the association is not as strong as that for D_D007674. We suggest that repeated D_D014947, including D_D007154, may be the cause of this lesion both in allografts and native kidneys.

title:Conformationally restricted analogs of C_C085527 and an antisense C_D009838 targeting sigma1 receptors produce anti-C_D003042 effects in mice.
abstract:C_D003042's ability to interact with sigma receptors suggests that these proteins mediate some of its behavioral effects. Therefore, three novel sigma receptor ligands with antagonist activity were evaluated in Swiss Webster mice: C_-1 (C_-1), C_C093337 (C_C093337), and C_-1 (1R,2S-(+)-cis-N-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexylamine). Competition binding assays demonstrated that all three compounds have high affinities for sigma1 receptors. The three compounds vary in their affinities for sigma2 receptors and exhibit negligible affinities for C_D004298, opioid, C_D005680(A) and C_D016202 receptors. In behavioral studies, pre-treatment of mice with C_-1, C_C093337, or C_-1 significantly attenuated C_D003042-induced D_D012640 and lethality. Moreover, post-treatment with C_-1 prevented C_D003042-induced lethality in a significant proportion of animals. In contrast to the protection provided by the putative antagonists, the well-characterized sigma receptor agonist C_C050232 (C_C050232) and the novel sigma receptor agonist C_-1 (C_-1) each worsened the behavioral D_D064420 of C_D003042. At doses where alone, they produced no significant effects on locomotion, C_-1, C_C093337 and C_-1 significantly attenuated the locomotor stimulatory effects of C_D003042. To further validate the hypothesis that the anti-C_D003042 effects of the novel ligands involved antagonism of sigma receptors, an antisense C_D009838 against sigma1 receptors was also shown to significantly attenuate the D_D012640 and locomotor stimulatory effects of C_D003042. Together, the data suggests that functional antagonism of sigma receptors is capable of attenuating a number of C_D003042-induced behaviors.

title:Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic assessment of the effects of C_C063968, C_D020117, C_D016593 and C_C010637 on monophasic action potential duration in dog.
abstract:1. D_D016171 (D_D016171) is a potentially fatal D_D017180 associated with increases in QT interval and monophasic action potential duration (MAPD). D_D016171 is a side-effect that has led to withdrawal of several drugs from the market (e.g. C_D016593 and C_C010637). 2. The potential of compounds to cause D_D016171 was evaluated by monitoring their effects on MAPD in dog. Four compounds known to increase QT interval and cause D_D016171 were investigated: C_D016593, C_C010637, C_D020117 and C_C063968. On the basis that only free drug in the systemic circulation will elicit a pharmacological response target, free concentrations in plasma were selected to mimic the free drug exposures in man. Infusion regimens were designed that rapidly achieved and maintained target-free concentrations of these drugs in plasma and data on the relationship between free concentration and changes in MAPD were obtained for these compounds. 3. These data indicate that the free ED50 in plasma for C_D016593 (1.9 nM), C_C010637 (76 nM), C_D020117 (11 nM) and C_C063968 (1.9 nM) closely correlate with the free concentration in man causing QT effects. For compounds that have shown D_D016171 in the clinic (C_D016593, C_C010637, C_D020117) there is little differentiation between the dog ED50 and the efficacious free plasma concentrations in man (< 10-fold) reflecting their limited safety margins. These data underline the need to maximize the therapeutic ratio with respect to D_D016171 in potential development candidates and the importance of using free drug concentrations in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies.

abstract:We report on two fatal cases of accidental intrathecal C_D014750e instillation in a 5-year old girl with recurrent D_D054198 and a 57-year old man with D_D054198. The girl died seven days, the man four weeks after intrathecal injection of C_D014750e. Clinically, the onset was characterized by the signs of opistothonus, sensory and motor dysfunction and ascending D_D010243. Histological and immunohistochemical investigations (HE-LFB, CD-68, Neurofilament) revealed degeneration of myelin and axons as well as D_-1 in areas exposed to C_D014750e, accompanied by secondary changes with numerous prominent macrophages. The clinical course and histopathological results of the two cases are presented. A review of all reported cases in the literature is given. A better controlled regimen for administering C_D014750e and intrathecal chemotherapy is recommended.

title:Intravenous administration of C_D011346 by 15-minute infusion versus 2-minute bolus does not affect the incidence of D_D017109: a prospective, randomized, controlled trial.
abstract:STUDY OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare the rate of D_D017109 after administration of intravenous C_D011346 as a 2-minute bolus or 15-minute infusion. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind study in the emergency department of a central-city teaching hospital. Patients aged 18 years or older treated with C_D011346 for D_D006261, D_D009325, or D_D014839 were eligible for inclusion. Study participants were randomized to receive 10 mg of C_D011346 administered intravenously by means of 2-minute push (bolus group) or 10 mg diluted in 50 mL of normal saline solution administered by means of intravenous infusion during a 15-minute period (infusion group). The main outcome was the number of study participants experiencing D_D017109 within 60 minutes of administration. Akathisia was defined as either a spontaneous report of restlessness or D_D011595 or a change of 2 or more in the patient-reported D_D017109 rating scale and a change of at least 1 in the investigator-observed D_D017109 rating scale. The intensity of D_D006261 and D_D009325 was measured with a 100-mm visual analog scale. RESULTS: One hundred patients were enrolled. One study participant was excluded after protocol violation. Seventy-three percent (73/99) of the study participants were treated for D_D006261 and 70% (70/99) for D_D009325. In the bolus group, 26.0% (13/50) had D_D017109 compared with 32.7% (16/49) in the infusion group (Delta=-6.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -24.6% to 11.2%). The difference between the bolus and infusion groups in the percentage of participants who saw a 50% reduction in their D_D006261 intensity within 30 minutes was 11.8% (95% CI -9.6% to 33.3%). The difference in the percentage of patients with a 50% reduction in their D_D009325 was 12.6% (95% CI -4.6% to 29.8%). CONCLUSION: A 50% reduction in the incidence of D_D017109 when C_D011346 was administered by means of 15-minute intravenous infusion versus a 2-minute intravenous push was not detected. The efficacy of C_D011346 in the treatment of D_D006261 and D_D009325 likewise did not appear to be affected by the rate of administration, although no formal statistical comparisons were made.

title:The relationship between hippocampal C_D000109 release and cholinergic convulsant sensitivity in withdrawal D_D012640-prone and withdrawal D_D012640-resistant selected mouse lines.
abstract:BACKGROUND: The septo-hippocampal cholinergic pathway has been implicated in epileptogenesis, and genetic factors influence the response to cholinergic agents, but limited data are available on cholinergic involvement in C_D000431 withdrawal severity. Thus, the relationship between cholinergic activity and responsiveness and C_D000431 withdrawal was investigated in a genetic animal model of C_D000431 withdrawal severity. METHODS: Cholinergic convulsant sensitivity was examined in C_D000431-na  ve Withdrawal D_D012640-Prone (WSP) and-Resistant (WSR) mice. Animals were administered C_D009538, C_D002217, or C_D009388 via timed tail vein infusion, and the latencies to onset of D_D014202 and clonus were recorded and converted to threshold dose. We also used microdialysis to measure basal and C_D011188-stimulated C_D000109 (C_D000109) release in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. C_D011188 was applied by reverse dialysis twice, separated by 75 min. Hippocampal C_D000109 also was measured during testing for handling-induced D_D012640. RESULTS: Sensitivity to several D_D012640 endpoints induced by C_D009538, C_D002217, and C_D009388 were significantly greater in WSR versus WSP mice. In microdialysis experiments, the lines did not differ in basal release of C_D000109, and 50 mM C_C522374 increased C_D000109 output in both lines of mice. However, the increase in release of C_D000109 produced by the first application of C_C522374 was 2-fold higher in WSP versus WSR mice. When hippocampal C_D000109 was measured during testing for handling-induced D_D012640, extracellular C_D000109 was significantly elevated (192%) in WSP mice, but was nonsignificantly elevated (59%) in WSR mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that differences in cholinergic activity and postsynaptic sensitivity to cholinergic D_D012640 may be associated with C_D000431 withdrawal severity and implicate cholinergic mechanisms in C_D000431 withdrawal. Specifically, WSP mice may have lower sensitivity to cholinergic D_D012640 compared with WSR because of postsynaptic receptor desensitization brought on by higher activity of cholinergic neurons.

title:Prenatal C_D003907 programs D_D006973 and D_D007674 in the rat.
abstract:Dexamethasone is frequently administered to the developing fetus to accelerate pulmonary development. The purpose of the present study was to determine if prenatal C_D003907 programmed a progressive D_D006973 and D_D007674 in rats. Pregnant rats were given either vehicle or 2 daily intraperitoneal injections of C_D003907 (0.2 mg/kg body weight) on gestational days 11 and 12, 13 and 14, 15 and 16, 17 and 18, or 19 and 20. Offspring of rats administered C_D003907 on days 15 and 16 gestation had a 20% D_D007674 compared with control at 6 to 9 months of age (22 527+/-509 versus 28 050+/-561, P<0.05), which was comparable to the percent reduction in glomeruli measured at 3 weeks of age. Six- to 9-month old rats receiving prenatal C_D003907 on days 17 and 18 of gestation had a 17% reduction in glomeruli (23 380+/-587) compared with control rats (P<0.05). Male rats that received prenatal C_D003907 on days 15 and 16, 17 and 18, and 13 and 14 of gestation had D_D006973 at 6 months of age; the latter group did not have a D_D007674. Adult rats given C_D003907 on days 15 and 16 of gestation had more glomeruli with D_D005921 than control rats. This study shows that prenatal C_D003907 in rats results in a D_D007674, D_D005921, and D_D006973 when administered at specific points during gestation. D_D006973 was observed in animals that had a reduction in glomeruli as well as in a group that did not have a D_D007674, suggesting that a D_D007674 is not the sole cause for the development of D_D006973.

title:The risk of D_D054556 in women prescribed C_D017373 in combination with C_D004997: a nested cohort analysis and case-control study.
abstract:BACKGROUND: C_D017373 combined with C_D004997 (C_D017373/C_D004997) is licensed in the UK for the treatment of women with D_D000152 and D_D006628 and is also a treatment option for D_D011085 (D_D011085). Previous studies have demonstrated an increased risk of D_D054556 (D_D054556) associated with C_D017373/C_D004997 compared with conventional combined C_D003276 (COCs). We believe the results of those studies may have been affected by residual confounding. METHODS: Using the General Practice Research Database we conducted a cohort analysis and case-control study nested within a population of women aged between 15 and 39 years with D_D000152, D_D006628 or D_D011085 to estimate the risk of D_D054556 associated with C_D017373/C_D004997. RESULTS: The age-adjusted incidence rate ratio for C_D017373/C_D004997 versus conventional COCs was 2.20 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35-3.58]. Using as the reference group women who were not using oral contraception, had no recent pregnancy or menopausal symptoms, the case-control analysis gave an adjusted odds ratio (OR(adj)) of 7.44 (95% CI 3.67-15.08) for C_D017373/C_D004997 use compared with an OR(adj) of 2.58 (95% CI 1.60-4.18) for use of conventional COCs. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated an increased risk of D_D054556 associated with the use of C_D017373/C_D004997 in women with D_D000152, D_D006628 or D_D011085 although residual confounding by indication cannot be excluded.

title:D_D004194 induced by the long-term use of C_D008914.
abstract:D_D000172 is an D_D004700 caused by chronic excessive growth hormone secretion from the anterior pituitary gland. Significant disfiguring changes occur as a result of bone, cartilage, and soft tissue D_D006984, including the thickening of the skin, coarsening of facial features, and D_C535610. D_D004194, on the other hand, is the presence of similar acromegaloid features in the absence of elevated growth hormone or insulin-like growth factor levels. We present a patient with D_D004194 that resulted from the long-term use of C_D008914 at an unusually high dose. This is the first case report of D_D004194 as a side effect of C_D008914 use.

title:Combined androgen blockade-induced D_D000740 in D_D011471 patients without bone involvement.
abstract:BACKGROUND: To determine the onset and extent of combined androgen blockade (CAB)-induced D_D000740 in D_D011471 patients without bone involvement. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients with biopsy-proven D_D000230 [26 with stage C (T3N0M0) and 16 with stage D1 (T3N1M0)] were included in this study. All patients received CAB [C_D016729 (C_D016729) 3.75 mg, intramuscularly, every 28 days plus 250 mg C_D005485, tid, per Os] and were evaluated for D_D000740 by physical examination and laboratory tests at baseline and 4 subsequent intervals (1, 2, 3 and 6 months post-CAB). Hb, PSA and C_D013739 measurements were recorded. Patients with stage D2-3 disease, abnormal hemoglobin level or renal and liver function tests that were higher than the upper limits were excluded from the study. The duration of the study was six months. RESULTS: The mean hemoglobin (Hb) levels were significantly declined in all patients from baseline of 14.2 g/dl to 14.0 g/dl, 13.5 g/dl, 13.2 g/dl and 12.7 g/dl at 1, 2, 3 and 6 months post-CAB, respectively. Severe and clinically evident D_D000740 of Hb < 11 g/dl with clinical symptoms was detected in 6 patients (14.3%). This CAB-induced D_D000740 was normochromic and normocytic. At six months post-CAB, patients with severe D_D000740 had a Hb mean value of 10.2 +/- 0.1 g/dl (X +/- SE), whereas the other patients had mild D_D000740 with Hb mean value of 13.2 +/- 0.17 (X +/- SE). The development of severe D_D000740 at 6 months post-CAB was predictable by the reduction of Hb baseline value of more than 2.5 g/dl after 3 months of CAB (p = 0.01). The development of severe CAB-induced D_D000740 in D_D011471 patients did not correlate with T baseline values (T < 3 ng/ml versus T > or = 3 ng/ml), with age (< 76 yrs versus > or = 76 yrs), and clinical stage (stage C versus stage D1). Severe and clinically evident D_D000740 was easily corrected by subcutaneous injections (3 times/week for 1 month) of recombinant erythropoietin (rHuEPO-beta). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that rHuEPO-beta correctable CAB-induced D_D000740 occurs in 14.3% of D_D011471 patients after 6 months of therapy.

abstract:Although the United States Food and Drug Administration banned its use for D_D020922 due to lack of safety and efficacy, C_D011803 is widely available in beverages including tonic water and bitter lemon. Numerous anecdotal reports suggest that products containing C_D011803 may produce D_D002493, including D_D003221, altered mental status, D_D012640, and D_D003128, particularly in older women. Psychologists need to inquire about consumption of C_D011803-containing beverages as part of an evaluation process.

title:C_D010755-induced D_D012640 and prevention of D_D004194.
abstract:Such C_D010755 (C_D010755) compounds as C_D007531 (C_D007531), C_D012524 and C_D012999 are potent inhibitors of C_D000109sterases (C_D000109Es) and butyrylcholinesterases (BChEs). The acute D_D064420 of C_D010755s is the result of their irreversible binding with C_D000109Es in the central nervous system (CNS), which elevates C_D000109 (C_D000109) levels. The protective action of subcutaneously (SC) administered antidotes or their combinations in C_D007531 (2.0 mg/kg BW) intoxication was studied in 9-10-weeks-old Han-Wistar male rats. The rats received C_D000109E reactivator C_D011220 (C_D011220) (30.0 mg/kg BW), anticonvulsant C_D003975 (2.0 mg/kg BW), A(1)-C_D000241 receptor agonist N(6)-cyclopentyl C_D000241 (C_C048599) (2.0 mg/kg BW), C_D016202-receptor antagonist C_D016291 (+-C_D016291 hydrogen maleate) (2.0 mg/kg BW) or their combinations with cholinolytic drug C_D001285 (50.0 mg/kg BW) immediately or 30 min after the single SC injection of C_D007531. The control rats received C_D001285, but also saline and olive oil instead of other antidotes and C_D007531, respectively. All rats were terminated either 24 h or 3 weeks after the C_D007531 injection. The rats treated with C_D007531-C_D001285 showed severe typical C_D010755-induced D_D064420 signs. When C_C048599, C_D003975 or C_D011220 was given immediately after C_D007531-C_D001285, these treatments prevented, delayed or shortened the occurrence of serious signs of D_D011041. C_D001285-C_D016291 did not offer any additional protection against C_D007531 D_D064420. In conclusion, C_C048599, C_D003975 and C_D011220 in combination with C_D001285 prevented the occurrence of serious signs of D_D011041 and thus reduced the D_D064420 of C_D007531 in rat.

title:Differential modulation by C_D004967 of alpha2-adrenergic and I1-C_D048288 receptor-mediated D_D007022 in female rats.
abstract:We have recently shown that C_D004967 negatively modulates the D_D007022 effect of C_D003000 (mixed alpha2-/I1-receptor agonist) in female rats and implicates the cardiovascular autonomic control in this interaction. The present study investigated whether this effect of C_D004967 involves interaction with alpha2- and/or I1-receptors. Changes evoked by a single intraperitoneal injection of C_C032302 (600 microg/kg) or C_D008750 (100 mg/kg), selective I1- and alpha2-receptor agonists, respectively, in blood pressure, hemodynamic variability, and locomotor activity were assessed in radiotelemetered sham-operated and ovariectomized (Ovx) Sprague-Dawley female rats with or without 12-wk C_D004967 replacement. Three time domain indexes of hemodynamic variability were employed: the standard deviation of mean arterial pressure as a measure of blood pressure variability and the standard deviation of beat-to-beat intervals (SDRR) and the root mean square of successive differences in R-wave-to-R-wave intervals as measures of heart rate variability. In sham-operated rats, C_C032302 or C_D008750 elicited similar D_D007022 that lasted at least 5 h and was associated with reductions in standard deviation of mean arterial pressure. SDRR was reduced only by C_D008750. Ovx significantly enhanced the D_D007022 response to C_D008750, in contrast to no effect on C_C032302 D_D007022. The enhanced C_D008750 D_D007022 in Ovx rats was paralleled with further reduction in SDRR and D_D001523. Estrogen replacement (C_D004958 subcutaneous pellet, 14.2 microg/day, 12 wk) of Ovx rats restored the hemodynamic and locomotor effects of C_D008750 to sham-operated levels. These findings suggest that C_D004967 downregulates alpha2- but not I1-receptor-mediated D_D007022 and highlight a role for the cardiac autonomic control in C_D008750-C_D004967 interaction.

title:Cardioprotective effect of C_C007145 on C_D007545-induced D_D009203 in rats.
abstract:C_C007145 (C_C007145), an C_C007145 (C_C007145), is used in herbal and homeopathic medicine. The present study was done to investigate the protective effect of C_C007145 on experimentally induced D_D009203 in rats. Pretreatment of C_C007145, at a dose of 0.5 mL/100 g bodyweight per day, orally for 30 days, prevented the increase in lipid peroxidation and activity of marker enzymes observed in C_D007545-induced rats (85 mg kg(-1) s. c. for 2 days at an interval of 24 h). C_C007145 prevented the C_D007545-induced decrease in antioxidant enzymes in the heart and increased the rate of C_D000244-stimulated C_D010100 uptake and respiratory coupling ratio. C_C007145 protected against pathological changes induced by C_D007545 in rat heart. The results show that pretreatment with C_C007145 may be useful in preventing the damage induced by C_D007545 in rat heart.

title:Safety and adverse effects associated with C_D020849: multiple outcomes of C_D020849 evaluation.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of C_D020849 on major adverse events that occur with postmenopausal C_D004967 therapy or C_D013629. METHODS: The Multiple Outcomes of C_D020849 Evaluation, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial, enrolled 7,705 postmenopausal women with D_D010024. Women were randomly assigned to C_D020849 60 mg/d or 120 mg/d or placebo. Outcomes included D_D054556, D_D002386, D_D005705, and D_D004714 or cancer. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 3.3 years, C_D020849 was associated with an increased risk for D_D054556 (relative risk [RR] 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-3.8). The excess event rate was 1.8 per 1,000 woman-years (95% CI -0.5-4.1), and the number needed to treat to cause 1 event was 170 (95% CI 100-582) over 3.3 years. Risk in the C_D020849 group was higher than in the placebo group for the first 2 years, but decreased to about the same rate as in the placebo group thereafter. C_D020849 did not increase risk for D_D002386 (RR 0.9; 95% CI 0.8-1.1), D_D005705 (RR 1.0; 95% CI 0.7-1.3), D_D004714 (RR 1.3; 95% CI 0.4-5.1), or D_D016889 (RR 0.9; 95% CI 0.3-2.7). CONCLUSION: C_D020849 was associated with an increased risk for D_D054556, but there was no increased risk for D_D002386, D_D005705, D_D004714, or D_D016889. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: I

title:C_D002443-associated D_D001660 in paediatric surgical patients.
abstract:It is well known that C_D002443 leads to D_D001660 in some patients. Clinical and experimental studies also suggest that situations causing D_D005705, such as fasting, may have a role for the development of D_D001660. In this study, we prospectively evaluated the incidence and clinical importance of D_D001660 in paediatric surgical patients receiving C_D002443 treatment, who often had to fast in the post-operative period. Fifty children who were given C_D002443 were evaluated by serial abdominal sonograms. Of those, 13 (26%) developed biliary pathology. Comparison of the patients with or without D_D001660 revealed no significant difference with respect to age, sex, duration of the treatment and starvation variables. After cessation of the treatment, D_D001660 resolved spontaneously within a short period. The incidence of D_D001660 is not affected by fasting.

title:Evaluation of the antiC_D003042 monoclonal antibody C_-1 as an immunotherapy for D_D062787.
abstract:The illicit use of C_D003042 continues in epidemic proportions and treatment for D_D062787 remains elusive. Current protein-based technology offers a new therapeutic venue by which antibodies bind the drug in the blood stream, inactivating its toxic effects. The therapeutic potential of the antiC_D003042 antibody C_-1 was examined using a model of D_D062787. Swiss albino mice prepared with intrajugular catheters were tested in photocell cages after administration of 93 mg/kg (LD50) of C_D003042 and C_-1 infusions ranging from 30 to 190 mg/kg. C_-1 was delivered 30 min before, concomitantly or 3 min after C_D003042 treatment. Significant blockade of C_D003042 D_D064420 was observed with the higher dose of C_-1 (190 mg/kg), where premorbid behaviors were reduced up to 40%, D_D012640 up to 77% and D_D003643 by 72%. Importantly, C_-1 prevented D_D003643 even post-C_D003042 injection. The results support the important potential of C_-1 as a therapeutic tool against D_D062787.

title:The effects of short-term C_D020849 therapy on fibrinolysis markers: TAFI, tPA, and PAI-1.
abstract:BACKGROUND: Markers of fibrinolysis, thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels were studied for the evaluation of short-term effects of C_D020849 administration in postmenopausal women. METHODS: Thirty-nine postmenopausal women with D_D001851 or D_D010024 were included in this prospective, controlled clinical study. Twenty-five women were given C_D020849 hydrochloride (60 mg/day) plus C_D002118 (500 mg/day). Age-matched controls (n = 14) were given only C_D002118. Plasma TAFI, tPA, and PAI-1 antigen levels were measured at baseline and after 3 months of treatment by commercially available ELISA kits. Variations of individuals were assessed by Wilcoxon's test. Relationship between those markers and demographic characteristics were investigated. RESULTS: Three months of C_D020849 treatment was associated with a significant decrease in the plasma TAFI antigen concentrations (16% change, P < 0.01), and a significant increase in tPA antigen concentrations (25% change, P < 0.05). A significant correlation was found between baseline TAFI antigen concentrations and the duration of D_D000568 (P < 0.05; r = 0.33). CONCLUSION: We suggest that the increased risk of D_D054556 due to C_D020849 treatment may be related to increased tPA levels, but not TAFI levels.

title:C_D007654 induced D_D016171 without concomitant use of QT interval-prolonging drug.
abstract:C_D007654 is not known to be proarrhythmic without concomitant use of QT interval-prolonging drugs. We report a woman with D_D003324 who developed a markedly D_D008133 and D_D016171 (D_D016171) after taking C_D007654 for treatment of D_D009181. Her QT interval returned to normal upon withdrawal of C_D007654. Genetic study did not find any mutation in her genes that encode cardiac IKr channel proteins. We postulate that by virtue of its direct blocking action on IKr, C_D007654 alone may prolong QT interval and induce D_D016171. This calls for attention when C_D007654 is administered to patients with risk factors for acquired D_D008133.

title:Pharmacological evidence for the potential of Daucus carota in the management of D_D003072.
abstract:The present study was aimed at investigating the effects of Daucus carota seeds on cognitive functions, total serum C_D002784 levels and brain cholinesterase activity in mice. The ethanolic C_D010936 (C_D010936) was administered orally in three doses (100, 200, 400 mg/kg) for seven successive days to different groups of young and aged mice. Elevated plus maze and passive avoidance apparatus served as the exteroceptive behavioral models for testing memory. C_D003975-, C_D012601- and ageing-induced D_D000647 served as the interoceptive behavioral models. C_D010936 (200, 400 mg/kg, p.o.) showed significant improvement in memory scores of young and aged mice. The extent of memory improvement evoked by C_D010936 was 23% at the dose of 200 mg/kg and 35% at the dose of 400 mg/kg in young mice using elevated plus maze. Similarly, significant improvements in memory scores were observed using passive avoidance apparatus and aged mice. Furthermore, C_D010936 reversed the D_D000647 induced by C_D012601 (0.4 mg/kg, i.p.) and C_D003975 (1 mg/kg, i.p.). C_D010936 (200, 400 mg/kg, p.o.) reduced significantly the brain acetylcholinesterase activity and C_D002784 levels in young and aged mice. The extent of inhibition of brain cholinesterase activity evoked by C_D010936 at the dose of 400 mg/kg was 22% in young and 19% in aged mice. There was a remarkable reduction in total C_D002784 level as well, to the extent of 23% in young and 21% in aged animals with this dose of C_D010936. Therefore, C_D010936 may prove to be a useful remedy for the management of D_D003072 on account of its multifarious beneficial effects such as, memory improving property, C_D002784 lowering property and anticholinesterase activity.

title:D_D011128 after epidural C_D013256 injection: a case report.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: Conventional treatment methods of lumbusacral D_D011843 are physical therapy, epidural C_D013256 injections, oral medications, and spinal manipulative therapy. D_D011128 is a rare complication of epidural anesthesia. The following case is a report of D_D011128 possibly caused by epidural injection of C_D014221 and C_D002045. CLINICAL FEATURES: A 50-year-old woman with low back and right leg pain was scheduled for epidural C_D013256 injection. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: An 18-gauge Touhy needle was inserted until loss of resistance occurred at the L4-5 level. Spread of the contrast medium within the epidural space was determined by radiographic imaging. After verifying the epidural space, C_D002045 and C_D014221 diacetate were injected. After the injection, there was a reduction in radicular symptoms. Three hours later, she complained of perineal D_D006987 and D_D020335. The neurologic evaluation revealed D_D006987 in the saddle area and medial aspect of her right leg. There was a decrease in the perception of pinprick test. Deep-tendon reflexes were decreased especially in the right leg. She was unable to urinate. The patient's symptoms improved slightly over the next few hours. She had a gradual return of motor function and ability of feeling Foley catheter. All of the symptoms were completely resolved over the next 8 hours. CONCLUSION: Complications associated with epidural C_D013256 injections are rare. Clinical examination and continued vigilance for D_D009422 after epidural C_D013256 injections is important.

title:High-dose C_D013739 is associated with D_D050197 in postmenopausal women.
abstract:OBJECTIVES: To study the long-term effects of androgen treatment on D_D050197 in postmenopausal women. METHODS: In a population-based study in 513 naturally postmenopausal women aged 54-67 years, we studied the association between self-reported intramuscularly administered high-dose C_D004967-C_D013739 therapy (estradiol- and C_D013739 esters) and aortic D_D050197. Aortic D_D050197 was diagnosed by radiographic detection of calcified deposits in the abdominal aorta, which have been shown to reflect intima D_D050197. Hormone therapy users were compared with never users. RESULTS: Intramuscular hormone therapy use for 1 year or longer was reported by 25 women. In almost half of these women severe D_D050197 of the aorta was present (n=11), while in women without hormone use severe D_D050197 of the aorta was present in less than 20% (OR 3.1; 95% CI, 1.1-8.5, adjusted for age, years since menopause, smoking, and body mass index). The association remained after additional adjustment for D_D003920, C_D002784 level, systolic blood pressure, or C_D000431 use. No association was found for hormone use less than 1 year. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that high-dose C_D013739 therapy may adversely affect D_D050197 in postmenopausal women and indicate that androgen replacement in these women may not be harmless.

title:C_D020123-associated D_D011507 and D_D007674.
abstract:C_D020123 is a novel immunosuppressant with potent antiproliferative actions through its ability to inhibit the raptor-containing mammalian target of C_D020123 protein kinase. C_D020123 represents a major therapeutic advance in the prevention of acute renal allograft rejection and chronic allograft D_D007674. Its role in the therapy of D_D005921, D_D001327, D_D052177 and D_D007680 is under investigation. Because C_D020123 does not share the vasomotor renal adverse effects exhibited by calcineurin inhibitors, it has been designated a 'non-D_D007674 drug'. However, clinical reports suggest that, under some circumstances, C_D020123 is associated with D_D011507 and acute D_D007674. A common risk factor appears to be presence of pre-existing D_D051436. The mechanisms of C_D020123-associated D_D011507 are multifactorial and may be due to an increase in glomerular capillary pressure following calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal. It has also been suggested that C_D020123 directly causes increased glomerular permeability/injury, but evidence for this mechanism is currently inconclusive. The acute D_D007674 associated with C_D020123 (such as in delayed graft function) may be due to suppression of compensatory renal cell proliferation and survival/repair processes. Although these adverse effects occur in some patients, their occurrence could be minimised by knowledge of the molecular effects of C_D020123 on the kidney, the use of C_D020123 in appropriate patient populations, close monitoring of D_D011507 and renal function, use of C_D000809-converting enzyme inhibitors or C_D000809 II receptor blockers if D_D011507 occurs and withdrawal if needed. Further long-term analysis of renal allograft studies using C_D020123 as de novo immunosuppression along with clinical and laboratory studies will refine these issues in the future.

title:Progressive D_D009135 with up-regulation of MHC-I associated with C_D019821 therapy.
abstract:C_D019821 can cause a necrotizing D_D009135 and D_-1 which is reversible on cessation of the drug. What is less well known is a phenomenon whereby C_D019821s may induce a D_D009135, which persists or may progress after stopping the drug. We investigated the muscle pathology in 8 such cases. All had myofibre D_D009336 but only 3 had an inflammatory infiltrate. In all cases there was diffuse or multifocal up-regulation of MHC-I expression even in non-D_D009336 fibres. Progressive improvement occurred in 7 cases after commencement of C_D011239 and C_D008727, and in one case spontaneously. These observations suggest that C_D019821s may initiate an immune-mediated D_D009135 that persists after withdrawal of the drug and responds to immunosuppressive therapy. The mechanism of this D_D009135 is uncertain but may involve the induction by C_D019821s of an endoplasmic reticulum stress response with associated up-regulation of MHC-I expression and antigen presentation by muscle fibres.

title:Direct inhibition of cardiac hyperpolarization-activated C_D009712-gated pacemaker channels by C_D003000.
abstract:BACKGROUND: Inhibition of cardiac sympathetic tone represents an important strategy for treatment of D_D002318, including D_D001145, D_D003327, and chronic D_D006333. Activation of presynaptic alpha2-adrenoceptors is the most widely accepted mechanism of action of the antisympathetic drug C_D003000; however, other target proteins have been postulated to contribute to the in vivo actions of C_D003000. METHODS AND RESULTS: To test whether C_D003000 elicits pharmacological effects independent of alpha2-adrenoceptors, we have generated mice with a targeted deletion of all 3 alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes (alpha2ABC-/-). Alpha2ABC-/- mice were completely unresponsive to the analgesic and hypnotic effects of C_D003000; however, C_D003000 significantly lowered heart rate in alpha2ABC-/- mice by up to 150 bpm. C_D003000-induced D_D001919 in conscious alpha2ABC-/- mice was 32.3% (10 microg/kg) and 26.6% (100 microg/kg) of the effect in wild-type mice. A similar bradycardic effect of C_D003000 was observed in isolated spontaneously beating right atria from alpha2ABC-knockout and wild-type mice. C_D003000 inhibited the native pacemaker current (I(f)) in isolated sinoatrial node pacemaker cells and the I(f)-generating hyperpolarization-activated C_D009712-gated (HCN) 2 and HCN4 channels in transfected HEK293 cells. As a consequence of blocking I(f), C_D003000 reduced the slope of the diastolic depolarization and the frequency of pacemaker potentials in sinoatrial node cells from wild-type and alpha2ABC-knockout mice. CONCLUSIONS: Direct inhibition of cardiac HCN pacemaker channels contributes to the bradycardic effects of C_D003000 gene-targeted mice in vivo, and thus, C_D003000-like drugs represent novel structures for future HCN channel inhibitors.

title:Influence of C_D012906 on developing cochlea. Does C_D012906 during pregnancy affect the amplitudes of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions in newborns?
abstract:OBJECTIVE: Maternal tobacco C_D012906 has negative effects on fetal growth. The influence of C_D012906 during pregnancy on the developing cochlea has not been estimated, although C_D012906 has been positively associated with D_D034381 in adults. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of maternal C_D012906 on transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) of healthy neonates. METHODS: This study was undertaken as part of neonatal screening for D_D034381 and involved both ears of 200 newborns. Newborns whose mothers reported C_D012906 during pregnancy (n=200 ears) were compared to a control group of newborns (n=200 ears), whose mothers were non-smokers. Exposure to tobacco was characterized as low (<5 cigarettes per day, n=88 ears), moderate (5< or =cigarettes per day<10, n=76) or high (> or =10 cigarettes per day, n=36). RESULTS: In exposed neonates, TEOAEs mean response (across frequency) and mean amplitude at 4000Hz was significantly lower than in non-exposed neonates. Comparisons between exposed newborns' subgroups revealed no significant differences. However, by comparing each subgroup to control group, we found statistically significant D_-1 at 4000Hz for all three groups. Mean TEOAEs responses of highly exposed newborns were also significantly lower in comparison to our control group. CONCLUSION: In utero, exposure to tobacco C_D012906 seems to have a small impact on outer hair cells. These effects seem to be equally true for all exposed newborns, regardless of the degree of exposure. Further studies are needed in order to establish a potential negative effect of maternal C_D012906 on the neonate's hearing acuity.

title:D_D020078 and D_D001523 after neonatal C_D013726 treatment in rats: implications for D_D001321.
abstract:D_D001321 is a D_D002658 presenting before 3 years of age with D_D003147 and D_D001523. In addition to genetic influences, recent studies suggest that prenatal drug or chemical exposures are risk factors for D_D001321. C_D013726, a beta2-adrenoceptor agonist used to arrest D_D007752, has been associated with increased concordance for D_D001321 in dizygotic twins. We studied the effects of C_D013726 on microglial activation in different brain regions and behavioral outcomes in developing rats. Newborn rats were given C_D013726 (10 mg/kg) daily on postnatal days (PN) 2 to 5 or PN 11 to 14 and examined 24 h after the last dose and at PN 30. Immunohistochemical studies showed that administration of C_D013726 on PN 2 to 5 produced a robust increase in microglial activation on PN 30 in the cerebral cortex, as well as in cerebellar and cerebrocortical white matter. None of these effects occurred in animals given C_D013726 on PN 11 to 14. In behavioral tests, animals treated with C_D013726 on PN 2 to 5 showed consistent patterns of hyper-reactivity to novelty and aversive stimuli when assessed in a novel open field, as well as in the acoustic startle response test. Our findings indicate that beta2-adrenoceptor overstimulation during an early critical period results in microglial activation associated with innate neuroinflammatory pathways and D_D001523, similar to those described in D_D001321. This study provides a useful animal model for understanding the neuropathological processes underlying D_D001321 spectrum disorders.

title:Acute D_D009205 associated with C_D003024.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: A case of acute D_D009205 associated with the commencement of C_D003024 is described, highlighting the onset, course and possible contributing factors. There is an urgent need to raise awareness about this potentially fatal complication of C_D003024 use. RESULTS: A 20-year-old male with D_D012559 developed a sudden onset of D_D009205 after commencement of C_D003024. The patient recovered with intensive medical support. The symptoms occurred around 2 weeks after starting C_D003024 in an inpatient setting. Possible contributing factors may have been concomitant C_D000928 use and unaccustomed physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: D_D009205 is an increasingly recognized complication associated with the use of C_D003024. It can be fatal if not recognized and treated early. Considering that C_D003024 remains the gold standard in treatment of resistant D_D011618, there is an urgent need to raise awareness among medical and paramedical staff involved in the care of these patients. There are also implications for recommendations and regulations regarding the use of C_D003024.

abstract:BACKGROUND: We report on the manifestation of a C_C026098 (C_C026098)-induced D_D001927. FINDINGS: A 28-year-old man suffering from D_C562694 with generalized D_D012640 was treated with C_C026098 (3000 mg) added to C_D014635 (C_D014635) (2000 mg). Frequency of generalized tonic-clonic D_D012640 increased from one per 6 months to two per month. Neuropsychological testing showed D_D008569. The interictal electroencephalogram (EEG) showed a generalized slowing to 5 per second theta rhythms with bilateral generalized high-amplitude discharges. OUTCOME: Following discontinuation of C_C026098, EEG and neuropsychological findings improved and D_D012640 frequency decreased.

title:C_D009638 signaling through beta-adrenergic receptors is critical for expression of C_D003042-induced D_D001008.
abstract:BACKGROUND: C_D003042 is a widely abused psychostimulant that has both rewarding and aversive properties. While the mechanisms underlying C_D003042's rewarding effects have been studied extensively, less attention has been paid to the unpleasant behavioral states induced by C_D003042, such as D_D001008. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the performance of C_D004298 beta-hydroxylase knockout (Dbh -/-) mice, which lack C_D009638 (C_D009638), in the elevated plus maze (EPM) to examine the contribution of noradrenergic signaling to C_D003042-induced D_D001008. RESULTS: We found that C_D003042 dose-dependently increased D_D001008-like behavior in control (Dbh +/-) mice, as measured by a decrease in open arm exploration. The Dbh -/- mice had normal baseline performance in the EPM but were completely resistant to the anxiogenic effects of C_D003042. C_D003042-induced D_D001008 was also attenuated in Dbh +/- mice following administration of C_D004221, a C_D004298 beta-hydroxylase (DBH) inhibitor. In experiments using specific adrenergic antagonists, we found that pretreatment with the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist C_D011433 blocked C_D003042-induced D_D001008-like behavior in Dbh +/- and wild-type C57BL6/J mice, while the alpha(1) antagonist C_D011224 and the alpha(2) antagonist C_D015016 had no effect. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that noradrenergic signaling via beta-adrenergic receptors is required for C_D003042-induced D_D001008 in mice.

title:C_D003000 for D_D001289: II. ECG changes and adverse events analysis.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: To examine the safety and tolerability of C_D003000 used alone or with C_D008774 in children with D_D001289 (D_D001289). METHOD: In a 16-week multicenter, double-blind trial, 122 children with D_D001289 were randomly assigned to C_D003000 (n = 31), C_D008774 (n = 29), C_D003000 and C_D008774 (n = 32), or placebo (n = 30). Doses were flexibly titrated up to 0.6 mg/day for C_D003000 and 60 mg/day for C_D008774 (both with divided dosing). Groups were compared regarding adverse events and changes from baseline to week 16 in electrocardiograms and vital signs. RESULTS: There were more incidents of D_D001919 in subjects treated with C_D003000 compared with those not treated with C_D003000 (17.5% versus 3.4%; p =.02), but no other significant group differences regarding electrocardiogram and other cardiovascular outcomes. There were no suggestions of interactions between C_D003000 and C_D008774 regarding cardiovascular outcomes. Moderate or severe adverse events were more common in subjects on C_D003000 (79.4% versus 49.2%; p =.0006) but not associated with higher rates of early study withdrawal. D_D006970 was common on C_D003000, but generally resolved by 6 to 8 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: C_D003000, used alone or with C_D008774, appears safe and well tolerated in childhood D_D001289. Physicians prescribing C_D003000 should monitor for D_D001919 and advise patients about the high likelihood of initial D_D006970.

title:C_D013792 has limited single-agent activity in relapsed or refractory indolent D_D008228: a phase II trial of the D_D009369 and D_D007938 Group B.
abstract:C_D013792 is an immunomodulatory agent with demonstrated activity in D_D009101, D_D020522 and D_D008223. Its activity is believed to be due modulation of the D_D009369 milieu, including downregulation of angiogenesis and inflammatory cytokines. Between July 2001 and April 2004, 24 patients with relapsed/refractory indolent D_D008223 received C_D013792 200 mg daily with escalation by 100 mg daily every 1-2 weeks as tolerated, up to a maximum of 800 mg daily. Patients had received a median of 2 (range, 1-4) prior regimens. Of 24 evaluable patients, two achieved a complete remission and one achieved a partial remission for an overall response rate of 12.5% (95% confidence interval: 2.6-32.4%). Eleven patients progressed during therapy. Grade 3-4 adverse effects included D_D001855, D_D005221, D_D006970/D_D003866, D_D009422 and D_D004417. Of concern was the occurrence of four D_D013923 events. Our results failed to demonstrate an important response rate to single agent C_D013792 in indolent D_D008223 and contrast with the higher activity level reported with the second generation immunomodulatory agent, C_C467567.

Adult male albino rats, treated with C_D007545 (200 mg/kg, s.c.) for 2 days at an interval of 24 h caused a significant (P<0.05) elevation of heart weight, serum marker enzymes, lipid peroxidation and C_D002118+2 ATPase level whereas there was a significant (P<0.05) decrease in body weight, endogenous antioxidants, C_D012964+/ C_D011188+ ATPase and C_D008274+2 ATPase levels. Administration of C_D010936 (100 mg/kg/day, p.o.) and C_D014810 (100 mg/kg/day, p.o.) together for 30 consecutive days and challenged with C_D007545 on the day 29th and 30th, showed a significant (P<0.05) decrease in heart weight, serum marker enzymes, lipid peroxidation, C_D002118+2 ATPase and a significant increase in the body weight, endogenous antioxidants, C_D012964+/C_D011188+ ATPase and C_D008274+2 ATPase when compared with C_D007545 treated group and C_D010936 or C_D014810 alone treated groups. These findings indicate the synergistic protective effect of C_D010936 and C_D014810 during C_D007545 induced D_D009203 in rats.

title:The C_D005998 transporter-1 inhibitor C_-1 displays a selective and specific antipsychotic-like profile in normal and transgenic mice.
abstract:D_D012559 has been initially associated with dysfunction in C_D004298 neurotransmission. However, the observation that antagonists of the C_D018698 C_D016202 (C_D016202) receptor produce D_D012559-like symptoms in humans has led to the idea of a dysfunctioning of the C_D018698rgic system via its C_D016202 receptor. As a result, there is a growing interest in the development of pharmacological agents with potential antipsychotic properties that enhance the activity of the C_D018698rgic system via a modulation of the C_D016202 receptor. Among them are C_D005998 transporter-1 (GlyT1) inhibitors such as C_-1, which indirectly enhance C_D016202 receptor function by increasing the C_D005998 (a co-agonist for the C_D016202 receptor) levels in the synapse. This study aimed at investigating the potential antipsychotic-like properties of C_-1, with a particular focus on models of D_D006948, involving either drug challenge (ie, C_D000661 and C_D016291) or transgenic mice (ie, C_D016202 Nr1(neo-/-) and DAT(-/-)). Results showed that C_-1 (10-30 mg/kg p.o.) blocked D_D006948 induced by the non-competitive C_D016202 receptor antagonist, C_D016291 and partially reversed spontaneous D_D006948 of C_D016202 Nr1(neo-/-) mice. In contrast, C_-1 failed to affect D_D006948 induced by C_D000661 or naturally observed in C_D004298 transporter (DAT(-/-)) knockout mice (10-30 mg/kg p.o.). Importantly, both classical (C_D006220) and atypical (C_C076029, C_D003024 and C_C094645) antipsychotics were effective in all these models of D_D006948. However, unlike these latter, C_-1 did not produce D_D002375 (retention on the bar test) up to 30 mg/kg p.o. Together these findings show that the GlyT1 inhibitor, C_-1, produces antipsychotic-like effects, which differ from those observed with compounds primarily targeting the C_D004298rgic system, and has a reduced side-effect potential as compared with these latter drugs.

title:C_D010656 but not C_D004809 D_D002534 following anesthesia-induced D_D007022.
abstract:BACKGROUND: Vasopressor agents are used to correct anesthesia-induced D_D007022. We describe the effect of C_D010656 and C_D004809 on frontal lobe oxygenation (S(c)O(2)) following anesthesia-induced D_D007022. METHODS: Following induction of anesthesia by C_D005283 (0.15 mg kg(-1)) and C_D015742 (2.0 mg kg(-1)), 13 patients received C_D010656 (0.1 mg iv) and 12 patients received C_D004809 (10 mg iv) to restore mean arterial pressure (MAP). Heart rate (HR), MAP, D_D020521 volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and frontal lobe oxygenation (S(c)O(2)) were registered. RESULTS: Induction of anesthesia was followed by a decrease in MAP, HR, SV, and CO concomitant with an elevation in S(c)O(2). After administration of C_D010656, MAP increased (51 +/- 12 to 81 +/- 13 mmHg; P < 0.001; mean +/- SD). However, a 14% (from 70 +/- 8% to 60 +/- 7%) reduction in S(c)O(2) (P < 0.05) followed with no change in CO (3.7 +/- 1.1 to 3.4 +/- 0.9 l min(-1)). The administration of C_D004809 led to a similar increase in MAP (53 +/- 9 to 79 +/- 8 mmHg; P < 0.001), restored CO (3.2 +/- 1.2 to 5.0 +/- 1.3 l min(-1)), and preserved S(c)O(2). CONCLUSIONS: The utilization of C_D010656 to correct D_D007022 induced by anesthesia has a negative impact on S(c)O(2) while C_D004809 maintains frontal lobe oxygenation potentially related to an increase in CO.

title:A novel, multiple symptom model of D_D009771 in animals.
abstract:BACKGROUND: Current animal models of D_D009771 (D_D009771) typically involve acute, drug-induced symptom provocation or a genetic association with stereotypies or D_D001008. None of these current models demonstrate multiple D_D009771-like behaviors. METHODS: Neonatal rats were treated with the tricyclic C_D000928 C_D002997 or vehicle between days 9 and 16 twice daily and behaviorally tested in adulthood. RESULTS: C_D002997 exposure in immature rats produced significant behavioral and biochemical changes that include enhanced D_D001008 (elevated plus maze and marble burying), D_-1 (perseveration in the spontaneous alternation task and impaired reversal learning), working D_D008569 (e.g., win-shift paradigm), D_D060845, and D_-1. C_D004298 D2 receptors were elevated in the striatum, whereas C_D012701 2C, but not C_D012701 1A, receptors were elevated in the orbital frontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first demonstration of multiple symptoms consistent with an D_D009771-like profile in animals. Moreover, these behaviors are accompanied by biochemical changes in brain regions previously identified as relevant to D_D009771. This novel model of D_D009771 demonstrates that drug exposure during a sensitive period can program disease-like systems permanently, which could have implications for current and future therapeutic strategies for this and other D_D001523.

title:Late recovery of renal function in a woman with the D_D006463.
abstract:A case is reported of the D_D006463 (D_D006463) in a woman taking C_D003276. She was treated with C_D006493, C_D004176 and hemodialysis; and after more than three months, her urinary output rose above 500 ml; and six months after the onset of D_D001002, dialysis treatment was stopped. This case emphasizes the possibility that D_D006463 in adults is not invariably irreversible and that, despite prolonged D_D009846, recovery of renal function can be obtained. Therefore, in adult patients affected by D_D006463, dialysis should not be discontinued prematurely; moreover, bilateral nephrectomy, for treatment of severe D_D006973 and D_D000743, should be performed with caution.

title:Effects of C_D001241, C_D004176, and C_D006854 on C_D004837-induced D_D009202 in dogs.
abstract:A reproducible model for producing diffuse D_D009202 (C_D004837 infusion) has been developed to study the cardioprotective effects of agents or maneuvers which might alter the evolution of acute D_D009203. Infusions of C_D004837 (4 mug per kilogram per minute for 6 hours) increased C_D002132 uptakes into intact myocardium and each of its subcellular components with the mitochondrial fraction showing the most consistent changes when compared to saline-infused control animals (4,957 vs. 827 counts per minute per gram of dried tissue or fraction). Myocardial concentrations of C_D002118 also increased significantly (12.0 vs. 5.0 mg.per 100 Gm. of fat-free dry weight). Infusions of C_D002118 chloride sufficient to raise serum C_D002118 concentrations 2 mEq. per liter failed to increase C_D002118 influx into the myocardial cell. Mitochondrial C_D002132 uptakes were significantly decreased in animals pretreated with C_D001241 or C_D004176 or when C_D006854 was added to the C_D004837 infusion (2,682,2,803, and 3,424 counts per minute per gram of dried fraction, respectively). Myocardial C_D002118 concentrations also were decreased (11.2, 8.3, and 8.9 mg. per 100 Gm. of fat-free dry weight, respectively) in the three treatment groups, being significantly decreased only in the last two. Evidence of microscopic damage was graded as less severe in the three treatment groups. C_D001241, C_D004176, and C_D006854 all appear to have cardioprotective effects when tested in this model.

title:Changes in D_D003866 status associated with topical beta-blockers.
abstract:D_D003866 and D_D012735 have been related to side effects of topical beta-blockers. We performed a preliminary study in order to determine any difference between a non selective beta-blocker (C_D013999) and a selective beta-blocker (C_D015784) regarding CNS side effects. Eight D_D005901 patients chronically treated with C_D013999 0.5%/12h, suffering from D_D003866 diagnosed through DMS-III-R criteria, were included in the study. During the six-month follow up, D_D003866 was quantified through the Beck and Zung-Conde scales every two months. In a double blind cross-over study with control group, the patients under C_D013999 treatment presented higher D_D003866 values measured through the Beck and the Zung-Conde scales (p < 0.001 vs control). These results suggest that C_D015784 could be less of a D_D003866-inducer than C_D013999 in predisposed patients.

title:Long-term follow-up of C_D007069 D_D007674 in children treated for D_C535700: an International Society of Pediatric Oncology report.
abstract:The renal function of 74 children with D_C535700 in complete remission and who have received the same C_D007069 chemotherapy protocol (International Society of Pediatric Oncology D_C535700 Study 84 [SIOP MMT 84]) were studied 1 year after the completion of treatment. Total cumulative doses were 36 or 60 g/m2 of C_D007069 (six or 10 cycles of C_D007069, vincristine, and dactinomycin [C_C064227]). None of them had received C_D002945 chemotherapy. Ages ranged from 4 months to 17 years; 58 patients were males and 42 females. The most common primary D_D009369 site was the head and neck. Renal function was investigated by measuring plasma and urinary electrolytes, D_D006030, D_D011507, D_D000608, urinary pH, osmolarity, C_D003404 clearance, C_D010710 tubular reabsorption, beta 2 microglobulinuria, and lysozymuria. Fifty-eight patients (78%) had normal renal tests, whereas 16 patients (22%) had D_D007674. Two subsets of patients were identified from this latter group: the first included four patients (5% of the total population) who developed major D_D064420 resulting in D_D005198 (D_D005198); and the second group included five patients with elevated beta 2 microglobulinuria and low C_D010710 reabsorption. The remaining seven patients had isolated beta 2 microglobulinuria. Severe D_D064420 was correlated with the higher cumulative dose of 60 g/m2 of C_D007069, a younger age (less than 2 1/2 years old), and a predominance of vesicoprostatic D_D009369 involvement. This low percentage (5%) of D_D005198 must be evaluated with respect to the efficacy of C_D007069 in the treatment of mesenchymal D_D009369s in children.

title:Evidence for an involvement of D1 and D2 C_D004298 receptors in mediating C_D009538-induced D_D006948 in rats.
abstract:Previous studies have suggested that repeated exposure of rats to the drug or to the experimental environment is necessary to observe C_D009538-induced locomotor stimulation. In the present study the role of habituation to the experimental environment on the stimulant effect of C_D009538 in rats was examined. In addition, the role of C_D004298 receptors in mediating C_D009538-induced locomotor stimulation was investigated by examining the effects of selective D1 and D2 C_D004298 receptor antagonists on activity induced by C_D009538. Locomotor activity was assessed in male Sprague-Dawley rats tested in photocell cages. C_D009538 (1.0 mg/kg) caused a significant D_D006948 in rats that were habituated to the test environment, but had only a weak and delayed stimulant action in rats that were unfamiliar with the test environment. The stimulant action of C_D009538 was blocked by the central nicotinic antagonist C_D008464 but not by the peripheral nicotinic blocker C_D018738, indicating that the response is probably mediated by central nicotinic receptors. C_D009538-induced D_D006948 was blocked by the selective D1 antagonist C_C534628, the selective D2 antagonist C_D020891 and the D1/D2 antagonist C_D005476. Pretreatment with the D2 agonist C_-1 enhanced C_D009538-induced D_D006948, whereas the D1 agonist C_D015647 had no effect. The results indicate that acute C_D009538 injection induces a pronounced D_D006948 in rats habituated to the test environment. The effect appears to be mediated by central C_D009538 receptors, possibly located on C_D004298rgic neurons, and also requires the activation of both D1 and D2 C_D004298 receptors.

title:Neuropsychiatric side effects after the use of C_D015767.
abstract:This study describes neuropsychiatric side effects in patients after treatment with C_D015767. Reactions consisted mainly of D_D012640, acute D_D011605, D_D001008, and major D_D012893. Side effects occurred after both therapeutic and prophylactic intake and were graded from moderate to severe. In a risk analysis of neuropsychiatric side effects in Germany, it is estimated that one of 8,000 C_D015767 users suffers from such reactions. The incidence calculation revealed that one of 215 therapeutic users had reactions, compared with one of 13,000 in the prophylaxis group, making the risk of neuropsychiatric reactions after C_D015767 treatment 60 times higher than after prophylaxis. Therefore, certain limitations for D_D008288 prophylaxis and treatment with C_D015767 are recommended.

title:Reduction in injection D_D010146 using buffered C_D008012 as a local anesthetic before cardiac catheterization.
abstract:Previous reports have suggested that D_D010146 associated with the injection of C_D008012 is related to the acidic pH of the solution. To determine if the addition of a buffering solution to adjust the pH of C_D008012 into the physiologic range would reduce D_D010146 during injection, we performed a blinded randomized study in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. Twenty patients were asked to quantify the severity of D_D010146 after receiving standard C_D008012 in one femoral area and buffered C_D008012 in the opposite femoral area. The mean D_D010146 score for buffered C_D008012 was significantly lower than the mean score for standard C_D008012 (2.7 +/- 1.9 vs. 3.8 +/- 2.2, P = 0.03). The pH adjustment of standard C_D008012 can be accomplished easily in the catheterization laboratory before injection and results in a reduction of the D_D010146 occurring during the infiltration of tissues.

title:Randomized, double-blind trial of C_D008454 in D_D020388.
abstract:There is evidence that growth hormone may be related to the progression of D_D018908 in D_D020388. We conducted a 12-month controlled trial of C_D008454, a putative growth hormone secretion inhibitor, in 83 boys with D_D020388. Muscle strength, contractures, functional ability and pulmonary function were tested at baseline, and 6 and 12 months after treatment with C_D008454 (3 mg/d) or placebo. The study was designed to have a power of greater than 0.90 to detect a slowing to 25% of the expected rate of progression of D_D018908 at P less than 0.05. C_D008454 did not benefit strength at any point in the study. Side effects attributable to C_D008454 included D_D001068 (36%), D_D014987 (10%), behavioral change (22%), and D_D012817 (18%); C_D008454 dosage was reduced in 43% of patients. The effect of C_D008454 on GH secretion was estimated indirectly by comparing the postabsorptive IGF-I levels obtained following 3, 6, 9, and 12 months in the C_D008454 treated to those in the placebo groups. Although C_D008454-treated patients gained less weight and height than placebo-treated patients, no significant effect on IGF-I levels was observed. C_D008454 doses not slow the progression of D_D018908 in D_D020388.

title:C_D010431 (C_D010431) does not inhibit C_D004176-induced coronary D_D006940: implications for C_D004176-C_D013793-201 myocardial imaging.
abstract:C_D004176-C_D013793-201 imaging is often performed in patients unable to exercise because of D_D016491. Many of these patients are taking C_D010431 (C_D010431), a C_C008514 derivative which may improve D_D007383. Whether C_D010431 inhibits C_D004176-induced coronary D_D006940 like other C_C008514s such as C_D013806 and should be stopped prior to C_D004176-C_D013793-201 imaging is unknown. Therefore, we studied the hyperemic response to C_D004176 in seven open-chest anesthetized dogs after pretreatment with either C_D010431 (0, 7.5, or 15 mg/kg i.v.) or C_D013806 (3 mg/kg i.v.). Baseline circumflex coronary blood flows did not differ significantly among treatment groups. C_D004176 significantly increased coronary blood flow before and after 7.5 or 15 mm/kg i.v. C_D010431 (p less than 0.002). Neither dose of C_D010431 significantly decreased the C_D004176-induced D_D006940, while peak coronary blood flow was significantly lower after C_D013806 (p less than 0.01). We conclude that C_D010431 does not inhibit C_D004176-induced coronary D_D006940 even at high doses.

title:Cause of D_D003643 among patients with D_D010300: a rare mortality due to D_D002543.
abstract:Causes of D_D003643, with special reference to D_D002543, among 240 patients with pathologically verified D_D010300 were investigated using the Annuals of the Pathological Autopsy Cases in Japan from 1981 to 1985. The leading causes of D_D003643 were D_D011014 and D_D001991 (44.1%), malignant D_D009369 (11.6%), D_D006331 (4.1%), D_D002544 (3.7%) and D_D018805 (3.3%). D_D002543 was the 11th most frequent cause of D_D003643, accounting for only 0.8% of D_D003643s among the patients, whereas it was the 5th most common cause of D_D003643 among the Japanese general population in 1985. The low incidence of D_D002543 as a cause of D_D003643 in patients with D_D010300 may reflect the D_D007022 effect of C_D007980 and a D_D007022 mechanism due to reduced C_D009638 levels in the D_D010300 brain.

title:Tolerance and antiviral effect of C_D012254 in patients with D_D006478.
abstract:Tolerance and antiviral effect of C_D012254 was studied in 6 patients with D_D006478 (D_D006478) of more than 8 days of evolution. Administration of C_D012254 resulted in a neutralization of D_D014766 and a drop of endogenous interferon titers. The average time of D_D003643 was delayed. A reversible D_D000740 was the only adverse effect observed. From these results, we conclude that C_D012254 has an antiviral effect in advanced cases of D_D006478, and that D_D000740, the only secondary reaction observed, can be easily managed. The possible beneficial effect of C_D012254 during the initial days of D_D006478 is discussed.

To our knowledge, this has not previously been reported as a side effect of preoperative C_D004176 therapy, although C_D004176-induced D_D017202 has been demonstrated to occur in animals and humans with D_D003324. Epicardial coronary collateral vessels were demonstrated in all four patients; a coronary "steal" phenomenon may be the mechanism of the C_D004176-induced D_D007511 observed.

title:Inhibition of immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing factor secretion into the hypophysial-portal circulation by delayed glucocorticoid feedback.
abstract:C_D009599-induced D_D007022 evokes ACTH secretion which is primarily mediated by enhanced secretion of immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing factor (irCRF) into the hypophysial-portal circulation. Portal plasma concentrations of neither C_D001127 nor C_D010121 are significantly altered in this paradigm. Application of a delayed feedback signal, in the form of a 2-h systemic C_D003345 infusion in C_D014520-anesthetized rats with pharmacological blockade of glucocorticoid synthesis, is without effect on the resting secretion of C_D001127 and C_D010121 at any C_D003345 feedback dose tested. Resting irCRF levels are suppressed only at the highest C_D003345 infusion rate, which resulted in systemic C_D003345 levels of 40 micrograms/dl. Suppression of irCRF secretion in response to C_D009599-induced D_D007022 is observed and occurs at a plasma C_D003345 level between 8-12 micrograms/dl. These studies provide further evidence for a strong central component of the delayed feedback process which is mediated by modulation of irCRF release.

title:Noradrenergic involvement in D_D002375 induced by C_D013759.
abstract:In order to elucidate the role of the catecholaminergic system in the cataleptogenic effect of C_D013759 (C_D013759), the effect of pretreatment with C_D016627 (C_D016627) or with C_D003891 and C_D016627 and lesions of the locus coeruleus were investigated in rats. The cataleptogenic effect of C_D013759 was significantly reduced in rats treated with C_D016627 and in rats with lesions of the locus coeruleus but not in rats treated with C_D003891 and C_D016627, as compared with control rats. On the contrary, the cataleptogenic effect of C_D006220 was significantly reduced in rats treated with C_D003891 and C_D016627 but not in rats treated with C_D016627 or in rats with lesions of the locus coeruleus. These results indicate that noradrenergic neurons have an important role in the manifestation of D_D002375 induced by C_D013759, whereas dopaminergic neurons are important in D_D002375 induced by C_D006220.

title:Intracranial pressure increases during C_D015760-induced D_D009127.
abstract:Intracranial pressure (ICP) was measured during C_D015760-induced D_D009127 in rats. Ten rats had arterial, central venous (CVP), and subdural cannulae inserted under C_D006221 anesthesia. The animals were mechanically ventilated to achieve normocarbia (PCO2 = 42 +/- 1 mmHg, mean +/- SE). Following instrumentation, C_D006221 was discontinued and C_D015760 (125 mu/kg) administered iv during emergence from C_D006221 anesthesia. In the five rats that developed somatic D_D009127, ICP and CVP increased significantly above baseline (delta ICP 7.5 +/- 1.0 mmHg, delta CVP 5.9 +/- 1.3 mmHg). These variables returned to baseline when D_D009127 was abolished with C_C032943. In five rats that did not become rigid, ICP and CVP did not change following C_D015760. These observations suggest that D_D009127 should be prevented when C_D015760, and, presumably, other opiates, are used in the anesthetic management of patients with ICP problems.

title:Adverse cardiac effects during induction chemotherapy treatment with C_D002945 and C_D005472.
abstract:Survival for patients with advanced D_D006258 and D_D004938 is poor with radiotherapy and/or surgery. Obviously, there is a need for effective chemotherapy. In the present study, C_D002945 (80-120 mg/m2BSA) and C_D005472 (1000 mg/m2BSA daily as a continuous infusion during 5 days) were given to 76 patients before radiotherapy and surgery. The aim of the study was to clarify the incidence and severity of adverse cardiac effects to this treatment. Before treatment all patients had a cardiac evaluation and during treatment serial ECG recordings were performed. In the pre-treatment evaluation, signs of D_D002318 were found in 33 patients (43%). During treatment, adverse cardiac effects were observed in 14 patients (18%). The mean age of these patients was the same as for the entire group, 64 years. The incidence of D_D066126 was not higher in patients with signs of D_D002318 than in those without in the pre-treatment evaluation. The most common signs of D_D066126 were D_D002637, ST-T wave changes and D_D001281. This was followed by D_D014693 in one patient and D_D003645 in another. It is concluded that patients on C_D005472 treatment should be under close supervision and that the treatment should be discontinued if D_D002637 or D_D013610 is observed.

title:Serial studies of D_D006311 in patients receiving C_D003676 therapy.
abstract:Visual and D_D006311 was previously documented in 42 of 89 patients with transfusion-dependent D_D000740 who were receiving C_D007501 chelation therapy with daily subcutaneous C_D003676. Twenty-two patients in the affected group had D_D006316 and in the hearing threshold levels of 30 to 100 decibels. When C_D003676 therapy was discontinued and serial studies were performed, audiograms in seven cases reverted to normal or near normal within two to three weeks, and nine of 13 patients with symptoms became asymptomatic. Audiograms from 15 patients remained abnormal and four patients required hearing aids because of D_D003638. Since 18 of the 22 patients were initially receiving C_D003676 doses in excess of the commonly recommended 50 mg/kg per dose, therapy was restarted with lower doses, usually 50 mg/kg per dose or less depending on the degree of D_D006311, and with the exception of two cases no further D_D064420 was demonstrated. Auditory deterioration and improvement, demonstrated serially in individual patients receiving and not receiving C_D003676, respectively, provided convincing evidence for a cause-and-effect relation between C_D003676 administration and otoD_D064420. Based on these data, a plan of management was developed that allows effective yet safe administration of C_D003676. A dose of 50 mg/kg is recommended in those without audiogram abnormalities. With mild D_D064420, a reduction to 30 or 40 mg/kg per dose should result in a reversal of the abnormal results to normal within four weeks. Moderate abnormalities require a reduction of C_D003676 to 25 mg/kg per dose with careful monitoring. In those with symptoms of D_D034381, the drug should be stopped for four weeks, and when the audiogram is stable or improved, therapy should be restarted at 10 to 25 mg/kg per dose. Serial audiograms should be performed every six months in those without problems and more frequently in young patients with normal serum ferritin values and in those with D_D006311.

Improvements were seen in the number of D_-1, the severity of D_D004487 and D_-1, the time of walk 50 feet, the duration of D_-1 and the circumference of the left knee. The most frequently observed side effect was D_-1 (25% of patients); however, there was no other evidence of D_D006471 in these patients. One patient was prematurely discontinued from the study for severe D_D006261 and D_D015746. Most side effects were mild and related to the GI tract.

title:The correlation between D_D020258 esterase inhibition and C_C005238-induced D_D009422 in rats.
abstract:The correlation between D_D009422 and inhibition of D_D020258 esterase or D_D009422 target enzyme (NTE) was examined in rats acutely exposed to C_C005238 (C_C005238), a D_D020258 C_D010755. Brain and spinal cord NTE activities were measured in Long-Evans male rats 1 hr post-exposure to various dosages of C_C005238 (ip, 1-15 mg/kg). These data were correlated with histologically scored cervical D_D013118 in a separate group of similarly dosed rats sampled 14-21 days post-exposure. Those dosages (greater than or equal to 10 mg/kg) that inhibited mean NTE activity in the spinal cord greater than or equal to 73% and brain greater than or equal to 67% of control values produced severe (greater than or equal to 3) cervical cord pathology in 85% of the rats. In contrast, dosages of C_C005238 (less than or equal to 5 mg/kg) which inhibited mean NTE activity in spinal cord less than or equal to 61% and brain less than or equal to 60% produced this degree of D_D013118 in only 9% of the animals. These data indicate that a critical percentage of NTE inhibition in brain and spinal cord sampled shortly after C_C005238 exposure can predict D_D009422 in rats several weeks later.

title:D_D002544 with a single oral dose of C_D010665.
abstract:C_D010665 (C_D010665), a synthetic sympathomimetic that is structurally similar to C_D000661, is available over the counter in anorectics, nasal congestants, and cold preparations. Its prolonged use or overuse has been associated with D_D012640, D_D002543, D_D001523, and nonhemorrhagic D_D002544. We report the case of a young woman who suffered a D_D002544 after taking a single oral dose of C_D010665.

abstract:C_D001379 treatment benefited 19 (66%) out of 29 patients suffering from severe D_D011565. Haematological complications were not troublesome and results of biochemical liver function tests remained normal. Minimal D_D002779 was seen in two cases and portal D_D005355 of a reversible degree in eight. Liver biopsies should be undertaken at regular intervals if C_D001379 therapy is continued so that structural D_D056486 may be detected at an early and reversible stage.

title:Maternal C_D008094 and neonatal D_D004437: evaluation with cross-sectional echocardiography.
abstract:Cross-sectional echocardiography was used to evaluate two neonates whose mothers ingested C_D008094 during pregnancy. In one infant, D_D004437 of the tricuspid valve was identified. In the other infant cross-sectional echocardiography provided reassurance that the infant did not have D_D004437. Cross-sectional echocardiographic screening of newborns exposed to C_D008094 during gestation can provide highly accurate, noninvasive assessment of the presence or absence of C_D008094-induced D_D006331.

title:Effects of training on the extent of experimental D_D009203 in aging rats.
abstract:The effects of exercise on the severity of C_D007545-induced D_D009203 were studied in female albino rats of 20,40,60 and 80 weeks of age. The rats were trained to swim for a specific duration and for a particular period. The occurrence of D_D007238 were confirmed by histological methods. Elevations in the serum GOT and GPT were maximum in the sedentary-C_D007545s and minimum in the exercise-controls. These changes in the serum transaminases were associated with corresponding depletions in the cardiac GOT and GPT. However, age was seen to interfere with the responses exhibited by the young and old rats. Studies dealing with D_D009203 are more informative when dealt with age.

C_D011092 impressively decreased both acute high-dose and chronic low-dose-C_D004317-associated lethality. Light microscopic analysis showed a significant protection against C_D004317-induced D_D009202. Such treatment did not diminish the C_D004317 antitumor activity in D_D007939 and in D_D002286.

title:Intra-arterial C_D002330 chemotherapy for treatment of D_D005910 of the central nervous system.
abstract:Because of the rapid systemic clearance of C_D002330 (C_D002330), intra-arterial administration should provide a substantial advantage over intravenous administration for the treatment of D_D005910. Thirty-six patients were treated with C_D002330 every 6 to 8 weeks, either by transfemoral catheterization of the internal carotid or vertebral artery or through a fully implantable intracarotid drug delivery system, beginning with a dose of 200 mg/sq m body surface area. Twelve patients with Grade III or IV D_D001254 were treated after partial resection of the D_D009369 without prior radiation therapy. After two to seven cycles of chemotherapy, nine patients showed a decrease in D_D009369 size and surrounding D_D004487 on contrast-enhanced computerized tomography scans. In the nine responders, median duration of chemotherapy response from the time of operation was 25 weeks (range 12 to more than 91 weeks). The median duration of survival in the 12 patients was 54 weeks (range 21 to more than 156 weeks), with an 18-month survival rate of 42%. Twenty-four patients with recurrent Grade I to IV D_D001254, whose resection and irradiation therapy had failed, received two to eight courses of intra-arterial C_D002330 therapy. Seventeen of these had a response or were stable for a median of 20 weeks (range 6 to more than 66 weeks). The catheterization procedure is safe, with no immediate complication in 111 infusions of C_D002330. A delayed complication in nine patients has been unilateral D_D014786 secondary to a D_D031300. The frequency of D_D014786 decreased after the concentration of the C_D000431 diluent was lowered.

title:Blood pressure response to chronic low-dose intrarenal C_D009638 infusion in conscious rats.
abstract:C_D012965 solution (0.9%) or C_D009638 in doses of 4, 12 and 36 micrograms h-1 kg-1 was infused for five consecutive days, either intrarenally (by a new technique) or intravenously into rats with one kidney removed. Intrarenal infusion of C_D009638 caused D_D006973 at doses which did not do so when infused intravenously. Intrarenal compared with intravenous infusion of C_D009638 caused higher plasma C_D009638 concentrations and a shift of the plasma C_D009638 concentration-blood pressure effect curve towards lower plasma C_D009638 levels. These results suggest that D_D006973 after chronic intrarenal C_D009638 infusion is produced by relatively higher levels of circulating C_D009638 and by triggering of an additional intrarenal pressor mechanism.

title:Age and renal clearance of C_D002927.
abstract:In 35 patients (ages 20 to 86 yr) receiving C_D002927 therapeutically two serum samples and all urine formed in the interim were collected for analysis of C_D002927 by high-pressure liquid chromatography and for C_D003404. C_D002927 clearance decreased with age. The extrapolated 6-hr serum concentration of C_D002927 per unit dose, after intravenous C_D002927, increased with age of the patients. The ratio of C_D002927 clearance to C_D003404 clearance (Rc) averaged 4.8 +/- 2.0, indicating net tubular secretion for C_D002927. Rc seemed to be independent of age and decreased with increasing serum concentration of C_D002927, suggesting that secretion of C_D002927 is a saturable process. There was only one case of D_D003704 possibly due to C_D002927 (with a drug level of 1.9 microgram/ml 6 hr after a dose) in a group of 13 patients without liver or kidney disease who had C_D002927 levels above 1.25 microgram/ml. Thus, high C_D002927 levels alone do not always induce D_D003704.

One patient, aged 23, had been followed for 2 years before D_D002277 was diagnosed; the second patient, aged 22, had been seen on a regular basis for 5 years, 8 months. In both instances, suspicion of the presence of D_D002277 was aroused by the palpation of a small nodule in the vaginal fornix. Hysterosalpingography was performed on both patients and, in 1 instance, an abnormal x-ray film was reflected by the gross appearance of the uterine cavity found in the surgical specimen.

title:C_D010634-induced D_D006529 in the rat: its relationship to C_D002251-induced D_D005355.
abstract:The yield of severe D_D005355 of the liver (defined as a shrunken finely nodular liver with micronodular histology, D_D001201 greater than 30 ml, plasma albumin less than 2.2 g/dl, D_D013163 2-3 times normal, and testicular D_D001284 approximately half normal weight) after 12 doses of C_D002251 given intragastrically in the C_D010634-primed rat was increased from 25% to 56% by giving the initial "calibrating" dose of C_D002251 at the peak of the C_D010634-induced D_D006529. At this point it was assumed that the cytochrome P450/C_D002251 toxic state was both maximal and stable. The optimal rat size to begin C_D010634 was determined as 100 g, and this size as a group had a mean maximum relative liver weight increase 47% greater than normal rats of the same body weight. The optimal time for the initial dose of C_D002251 was after 14 days on C_D010634.

title:Attenuation of the C_D008094-induced D_D003919 by C_D000584 in rats.
abstract:The effect of C_D000584 on C_D008094-induced D_D059606 and D_D011141 and on the C_D008094 concentration in the plasma, brain, kidney, thyroid and red blood cells was investigated in rats, chronically treated with C_D018021. C_D000584 reduced the drinking and urine volume of rats in an acute (6 or 12 h) and a subacute (3 days) experiment. 6 h after the administration of C_D000584, a reduction was observed in the C_D008094 content of the renal medulla but not in the other organs studied. At 12 h, all the tissues showed a slight increase in C_D008094 levels. After 3 days of combined treatment, a marked elevation in plasma and tissue C_D008094 levels accompanied a reduction in water intake. In all the experiments, the attenuation of the C_D008094-induced D_D003919 by C_D000584 was accompanied by a reduction of the ratio between the C_D008094 concentration in the renal medulla and its levels in the blood and an elevation in the plasma C_D011188 level. It is concluded that acute C_D000584 administration to C_D008094-treated patients suffering from D_D059606 and D_D011141 might relieve these patients but prolonged C_D000584 supplementation would result in elevated C_D008094 levels and might be hazardous.

title:Safety and side-effects of C_D000525. Controlled study in D_D000379 with D_D016584.
abstract:BACKGROUND: The widespread use of C_D001569 has led to increasing recognition of their unwanted effects. The efficacy of C_D000525 and placebo in D_D016584 with D_D000379, and the side-effect and adverse effect profiles of both drug groups were measured. METHOD: In London and Toronto 154 patients who met DSM-III criteria for D_D016584 with D_D000379 were randomised to C_D000525 or placebo. Subjects in each drug group also received either exposure or relaxation. Treatment was from weeks 0 to 8 and was then tapered from weeks 8 to 16. RESULTS: Mean C_D000525 dose was 5 mg daily. Compared with placebo subjects, C_D000525 patients developed more adverse reactions (21% v. 0%) of D_D003866, D_D004775, disinhibition and D_D001523; and more side-effects, particularly sedation, D_D001523, D_D008569, D_D015431 and D_D001259. Side-effects tended to diminish during treatment but remained significant at week 8. Despite this, the drop-out rate was low. CONCLUSIONS: C_D000525 caused side-effects and adverse effects during treatment but many patients were willing to accept these.

abstract:In an attempt to determine whether D_D004414 associated with intracorporeal injections could be due to the acidity of the medication, we performed a randomized study comparing the incidence of D_D004414 following intracorporeal injections with or without the addition of C_D017693 to the intracorporeal medications. A total of 38 consecutive patients who presented to our clinic with D_D007172 received 0.2 ml. of a combination of 3 drugs: 6 mg. C_D010208, 100 micrograms. C_D010646 and 10 micrograms. C_D000527 with (pH 7.05) or without (pH 4.17) the addition of C_D017693 (0.03 mEq.). Of the 19 patients without C_D017693 added to the medication 11 (58%) complained of D_D004414 due to the medication, while only 1 of the 19 men (5%) who received C_D017693 complained of D_D004414. From these data we conclude that the D_D004414 following intracorporeal injections is most likely due to the acidity of the medication, which can be overcome by elevating the pH to a neutral level.

title:Prospective study of the long-term effects of somatostatin analog (C_D015282) on gallbladder function and D_D042882 formation in Chinese D_D000172 patients.
abstract:This article reports the changes in gallbladder function examined by ultrasonography in 20 Chinese patients with active D_D000172 treated with sc injection of the somatostatin analog C_D015282 in dosages of 300-1500 micrograms/day for a mean of 24.2 +/- 13.9 months. During treatment with C_D015282, 17 patients developed sludge, 10 had D_D042882s, and 1 developed D_D041881 requiring surgery. In all of 7 patients examined acutely, gallbladder contractility was inhibited after a single 100-micrograms injection. In 8 patients followed for 24 weeks, gallbladder contractility remained D_D003866 throughout therapy. After withdrawal of C_D015282 in 10 patients without D_D042882s, 8 patients assessed had return of normal gallbladder contractility within 1 month. In 8 of the remaining 10 patients who developed D_D042882s during treatment, gallbladder contractility normalized in 5 patients (3 of whom has disappearance of their stones within 3 weeks), and remained D_D003866 in 3 (2 of whom had stones present at 6 months). Our results suggest that the suppression of gallbladder contractility is the cause of the successive formation of bile sludge, D_D042882s, and D_D002764 during C_D015282 therapy in Chinese D_D000172 patients. It is therefore very important to follow the changes of gallbladder function during long-term C_D015282 therapy of D_D000172 patients.

abstract:Seven patients suffering from D_D010300 (D_D010300) with severely disabling D_D004409 received low-dose C_D011433 as an adjunct to the currently used medical treatment. There was a significant 40% improvement in the D_D004409 score without increase of D_D010300 D_D009069. Ballistic and choreic D_D004409 were markedly ameliorated, whereas D_D004421 was not. This study suggests that administration of low doses of beta-blockers may improve C_D007980-induced ballistic and choreic D_D004409 in D_D010300.

title:Morphological features of D_D001927 after chronic administration of the antiepileptic drug C_D014635 to rats. A transmission electron microscopic study of capillaries in the cerebellar cortex.
abstract:Long-term intragastric application of the antiepileptic drug sodium C_D014635 (Vupral "Polfa") at the effective dose of 200 mg/kg b. w. once daily to rats for 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months revealed D_D009422 indicating D_D002526 ("C_D014635 D_D001927"). The first ultrastructural changes in structural elements of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) in the cerebellar cortex were detectable after 3 months of the experiment. They became more severe in the later months of the experiment, and were most severe after 12 months, located mainly in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex. Lesions of the capillary included D_D009336 of endothelial cells. Organelles of these cells, in particular the mitochondria (increased number and size, distinct degeneration of their matrix and cristae) and Golgi apparatus were altered. Reduced size of capillary lumen and occlusion were caused by swollen endothelial cells which had C_D010634 protrusions and swollen microvilli. Pressure on the vessel wall was produced by enlarged perivascular astrocytic processes. Fragments of D_D009336 endothelial cells were in the vascular lumens and in these there was loosening and breaking of tight cellular junctions. Damage to the vascular basement lamina was also observed. Damage to the capillary was accompanied by marked damage to neuroglial cells, mainly to perivascular processes of astrocytes. The proliferation of astrocytes (Bergmann's in particular) and occasionally of oligodendrocytes was found. Alterations in the structural elements of the BBB coexisted with marked lesions of neurons of the cerebellum (Purkinje cells are earliest). In electron micrographs both C_D010634 and antiC_D010634 sides of the BBB of the cerebellar cortex had similar lesions. The possible influence of the D_D056486, mainly D_D022124, upon the development of C_D014635 D_D001927 is discussed.

abstract:BACKGROUND: Although intravitreal C_D000617 have substantially improved visual prognosis in D_D009877, macular D_D007238 may impair full visual recovery. METHODS: We present a case of presumed C_D000583 retinal D_D064420 following treatment with C_D000583 and C_D014640 for alpha-haemolytic streptococcal D_D009877. RESULTS: D_D009877 resolved with improvement in visual acuity to 6/24 at three months. Fundus C_D019793 angiography confirmed macular capillary closure and D_D013684. CONCLUSIONS: Currently accepted intravitreal antibiotic regimens may cause retinal D_D064420 and macular D_D007511. Treatment strategies aimed at avoiding retinal D_D064420 are discussed.

title:Epidemic of D_D008107 caused by C_-1 used as C_D010126-sparing substitutes of C_D017402.
abstract:BACKGROUND: HydroC_D017402 (C_-1) are used increasingly in industry as substitutes for C_D010126-depleting C_D017402 (C_D017402). Limited studies in animals indicate potential D_D056486 of some of these compounds. We investigated an epidemic of D_D008107 in nine industrial workers who had had repeated accidental exposure to a mixture of C_C067411 (C_C067411) and C_C072959 (C_C072959). All nine exposed workers were affected to various degrees. Both compounds are metabolised in the same way as C_D006221 (C_D006221) to form reactive C_D014269 halide intermediates, which have been implicated in the D_D056486 of C_D006221. We aimed to test whether C_-1 123 and 124 can result in serious D_D008107. METHODS: For one severely affected worker liver biopsy and immunohistochemical stainings for the presence of C_D014269 protein adducts were done. The serum of six affected workers and five controls was tested for autoantibodies that react with human liver cytochrome-P450 2E1 (P450 2E1) and P58 protein disulphide isomerase isoform (P58). FINDINGS: The liver biopsy sample showed hepatocellular D_D009336 which was prominent in perivenular zone three and extended focally from portal tracts to portal tracts and centrilobular areas (bridging D_D009336). C_D014269-adducted proteins were detected in surviving hepatocytes. Autoantibodies against P450 2E1 or P58, previously associated with C_D006221 hepatitis, were detected in the serum of five affected workers. INTERPRETATION: Repeated exposure of human beings to C_-1 123 and 124 can result in serious D_D056486 in a large proportion of the exposed population. Although the exact mechanism of D_D056486 of these agents is not known, the results suggest that C_D014269-altered liver proteins are involved. In view of the potentially widespread use of these compounds, there is an urgent need to develop safer alternatives.

title:The effect of different anaesthetic agents in D_D034381 following spinal anaesthesia.
abstract:The cause of D_D034381 after spinal anaesthesia is unknown. Up until now, the only factor studied has been the effect of the diameter of the spinal needle on post-operative sensorineural D_D034381. The aim of this study was to describe this D_D034381 and to investigate other factors influencing the degree of D_D034381. Two groups of 22 similar patients were studied: one group received 6 mL C_D011318 2%; and the other received 3 mL C_D002045 0.5%. Patients given C_D011318 were more likely to develop D_D034381 (10 out of 22) than those given C_D002045 (4 out of 22) (P < 0.05). The average D_D034381 for speech frequencies was about 10 dB after C_D011318 and 15 dB after C_D002045. None of the patients complained of subjective D_D034381. Long-term follow-up of the patients was not possible.

title:A transient D_D009461 following intrathecal injection of 1% hyperbaric C_D002045 for unilateral spinal anaesthesia.
abstract:We describe a case of transient D_D009461 that occurred after unilateral spinal anaesthesia with 8 mg of 1% hyperbaric C_D002045 slowly injected through a 25-gauge pencil-point spinal needle. The surgery and anaesthesia were uneventful, but 3 days after surgery, the patient reported an area of hypoaesthesia over L3-L4 dermatomes of the leg which had been operated on (D_D012678) without reduction in muscular strength. Sensation in this area returned to normal over the following 2 weeks. Prospective multicentre studies with a large population and a long follow-up should be performed in order to evaluate the incidence of this unusual side effect. However, we suggest that a low solution concentration should be preferred for unilateral spinal anaesthesia with a hyperbaric anaesthetic solution (if pencil-point needle and slow injection rate are employed), in order to minimize the risk of a localized high peak anaesthetic concentration, which might lead to a transient D_D009461.

title:C_D008614-associated D_D012640 in a healthy adolescent receiving C_D008614 for D_D010149 control.
abstract:A healthy 17-year-old male received standard intermittent doses of C_D008614 via a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump for management of D_D010149 control. Twenty-three h postoperatively he developed a brief self-limited D_D012640. Both plasma C_D008614 and norC_D008614 were elevated in the range associated with clinical manifestations of central nervous system excitation. No other risk factors for CNS D_D064420 were identified. This method allowed frequent self-dosing of C_D008614 at short time intervals and rapid accumulation of C_D008614 and norC_D008614. The routine use of C_D008614 via PCA even for a brief postoperative analgesia should be reconsidered.

title:Drug-associated acute-onset D_D001649 and D_D013262 in a child.
abstract:Acute D_D001649 syndrome is a rare but established cause of progressive D_D002779 in adults, is most often drug or toxin related, and is of unknown pathogenesis. It has not been reported previously in children. D_D013262 is a well-recognized immune complex-mediated D_D004342 reaction that affects all age groups, is drug or D_D007239 induced, and has classic systemic, mucosal, and dermatologic manifestations. A previously healthy child who developed acute, severe, rapidly progressive D_D001649 syndrome shortly after D_D013262 is described; this was temporally associated with C_D007052 use. Despite therapy with C_D014580, C_D011241, and then C_D016559, her D_D002779 was unrelenting, with D_D005355 shown by biopsy 6 months after presentation. This case documents acute drug-related D_D001649 syndrome in the pediatric age group and suggests shared immune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of both D_D013262 and D_D001649 syndrome.

title:High incidence of D_D006976 associated with C_D001067 in Belgium.
abstract:D_D006976 is a rare, progressive and incurable disease, which has been associated with the intake of C_D001067 drugs. The importance of this association was evaluated in Belgium while this country still had no restriction on the prescription of C_D001067. Thirty-five patients with D_D006976 and 85 matched controls were recruited over 32 months (1992-1994) in Belgium. Exposure to C_D001067 was assessed on the basis of hospital records and standardized interview. Twenty-three of the patients had previously taken C_D001067, mainly C_D005277, as compared with only 5 of the controls (66 versus 6%, p<0.0001). Five patients died before the interview, all of them had taken C_D001067. In 8 patients the diagnosis of D_D006976 was uncertain, 5 of them had taken C_D001067. The patients who had been exposed to C_D001067 tended to be on average more severely ill, and to have a shorter median delay between onset of symptoms and diagnosis. A policy of unrestricted prescription of C_D001067 may lead to a high incidence of associated D_D006976. Intake of C_D001067 may accelerate the progression of the disease.

This is a case report of euphoria and D_D002819 both transiently induced by rapid adjustment to the selective mu-opioid receptor agonist C_D008691 in an inpatient previously abusing C_D003932 and C_D003042.

title:C_D003042-induced D_D019964: prevalence rates and D_D001523 symptoms in an outpatient C_D003042-dependent sample.
abstract:This paper attempts to examine and compare prevalence rates and symptom patterns of DSM substance-induced and other D_D019964s. 243 C_D003042-dependent outpatients with C_D003042-induced D_D019964 (D_D019970), other D_D019964s, or no D_D019964 were compared on measures of D_D001523 symptoms. The prevalence rate for D_D019970 was 12% at baseline. Introduction of the DSM-IV diagnosis of D_D019970 did not substantially affect rates of the other D_D003866. Patients with D_D019970 had symptom severity levels between those of patients with and without a D_D019964. These findings suggest some validity for the new DSM-IV diagnosis of D_D019970, but also suggest that it requires further specification and replication.

title:D_D006461 of human erythrocytes induced by C_D013629 is related to disruption of membrane structure.
abstract:C_D013629 (C_D013629), the antiestrogenic drug most widely prescribed in the chemotherapy of D_D001943, induces changes in normal discoid shape of erythrocytes and D_D000743. This work evaluates the effects of C_D013629 on isolated human erythrocytes, attempting to identify the underlying mechanisms on C_D013629-induced D_D000743 and the involvement of biomembranes in its cytostatic action mechanisms. C_D013629 induces D_D006461 of erythrocytes as a function of concentration. The extension of D_D006461 is variable with erythrocyte samples, but 12.5 microM C_D013629 induces total D_D006461 of all tested suspensions. Despite inducing extensive erythrocyte lysis, C_D013629 does not shift the osmotic fragility curves of erythrocytes. The D_D006461 effect of C_D013629 is prevented by low concentrations of C_D024502 (C_D024502) and C_D024502 acetate (C_D024502Ac) (inactivated functional C_D017665) indicating that C_D013629-induced D_D006461 is not related to oxidative membrane damage. This was further evidenced by absence of C_D010100 consumption and hemoglobin oxidation both determined in parallel with C_D013629-induced D_D006461. Furthermore, it was observed that C_D013629 inhibits the peroxidation of human erythrocytes induced by C_C046728, thus ruling out C_D013629-induced cell oxidative stress. D_D006461 caused by C_D013629 was not preceded by the leakage of C_D011188(+) from the cells, also excluding a colloid-osmotic type mechanism of D_D006461, according to the effects on osmotic fragility curves. However, C_D013629 induces release of peripheral proteins of membrane-cytoskeleton and cytosol proteins essentially bound to band 3. Either C_D024502 or C_D024502Ac increases membrane packing and prevents C_D013629 partition into model membranes. These effects suggest that the protection from D_D006461 by C_D024505 is related to a decreased C_D013629 incorporation in condensed membranes and the structural damage of the erythrocyte membrane is consequently avoided. Therefore, C_D013629-induced D_D006461 results from a structural perturbation of red cell membrane, leading to changes in the framework of the erythrocyte membrane and its cytoskeleton caused by its high partition in the membrane. These defects explain the abnormal erythrocyte shape and decreased mechanical stability promoted by C_D013629, resulting in D_D000743. Additionally, since membrane leakage is a final stage of cytotoxicity, the disruption of the structural characteristics of biomembranes by C_D013629 may contribute to the multiple mechanisms of its anticancer action.

title:Changes of C_D012964 and C_D000255 affinities of the cardiac (C_D012964,C_D011188)-C_D000255ase during and after C_D009569 deficient D_D006973.
abstract:In the cardiovascular system, C_D009569 is involved in the regulation of a variety of functions. Inhibition of C_D009569 synthesis induces sustained D_D006973. In several models of D_D006973, elevation of intracellular C_D012964 level was documented in cardiac tissue. To assess the molecular basis of disturbances in transmembraneous transport of C_D012964+, we studied the response of cardiac (C_D012964,C_D011188)-C_D000255ase to C_D009569-deficient D_D006973 induced in rats by C_D009569-synthase inhibition with 40 mg/kg/day C_D019331 (C_D019331) for 4 four weeks. After 4-week administration of C_D019331, the systolic blood pressure (SBP) increased by 36%. Two weeks after terminating the treatment, the SBP recovered to control value. When activating the (C_D012964,C_D011188)-C_D000255ase with its substrate C_D000255, no changes in C_D011188m and Vmax values were observed in C_D009569-deficient rats. During activation with C_D012964+, the Vmax remained unchanged, however the C_D011188(C_D012964) increased by 50%, indicating a profound decrease in the affinity of the C_D012964+-binding site in C_D009569-deficient rats. After recovery from D_D006973, the activity of (C_D012964,C_D011188)-C_D000255ase increased, due to higher affinity of the C_D000255-binding site, as revealed from the lowered C_D011188m value for C_D000255. The C_D011188(C_D012964) value for C_D012964+ returned to control value. Inhibition of C_D009569-synthase induced a reversible D_D006973 accompanied by D_D003866 C_D012964+-extrusion from cardiac cells as a consequence of deteriorated C_D012964+-binding properties of the (C_D012964,C_D011188)-C_D000255ase. After recovery of blood pressure to control values, the extrusion of C_D012964+ from cardiac cells was normalized, as revealed by restoration of the (C_D012964,C_D011188)-C_D000255ase activity.

title:Effects of long-term pretreatment with C_D007545 on C_D001971-induced D_D013610 in conscious rats.
abstract:It has been shown that C_D001971-induced D_D013610, which persisted after adrenalectomy, is (i) mediated by central C_D004298 D2 receptor activation and (ii) reduced by 5-day C_D007545 pretreatment, supporting therefore the hypothesis that this effect is dependent on sympathetic outflow to the heart. This study was conducted to examine whether prolonged pretreatment with C_D007545 could abolish C_D001971-induced D_D013610 in conscious rats. C_D007545 pretreatment for 15 days caused D_D006332 without affecting baseline blood pressure and heart rate. In control rats, intravenous C_D001971 (150 microg/kg) induced significant D_D007022 and D_D013610. C_D001971-induced D_D007022 was unaffected by C_D007545 pretreatment, while D_D013610 was reversed to significant D_D001919, an effect that was partly reduced by i.v. C_D004294 (0.5 mg/kg). Neither cardiac vagal nor sympathetic tone was altered by C_D007545 pretreatment. In isolated perfused heart preparations from C_D007545-pretreated rats, the C_D007545-induced maximal increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was significantly reduced, compared with saline-pretreated rats (the EC50 of the C_D007545-induced increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was enhanced approximately 22-fold). These results show that 15-day C_D007545 pretreatment not only abolished but reversed C_D001971-induced D_D013610 to D_D001919, an effect that is mainly related to further cardiac beta-adrenoceptor desensitization rather than to impairment of autonomic regulation of the heart. They suggest that, in normal conscious rats, the central D_D013610 of C_D001971 appears to predominate and to mask the D_D001919 of this agonist at peripheral C_D004298 D2 receptors.

title:A developmental analysis of C_D003000's effects on cardiac rate and ultrasound production in infant rats.
abstract:Under controlled conditions, infant rats emit ultrasonic vocalizations during extreme cold exposure and after administration of the alpha(2) adrenoceptor agonist, C_D003000. Previous investigations have determined that, in response to C_D003000, ultrasound production increases through the 2nd-week postpartum and decreases thereafter. Given that sympathetic neural dominance exhibits a similar developmental pattern, and given that C_D003000 induces sympathetic withdrawal and D_D001919, we hypothesized that C_D003000's developmental effects on cardiac rate and ultrasound production would mirror each other. Therefore, in the present experiment, the effects of C_D003000 administration (0.5 mg/kg) on cardiac rate and ultrasound production were examined in 2-, 8-, 15-, and 20-day-old rats. Age-related changes in ultrasound production corresponded with changes in cardiovascular variables, including baseline cardiac rate and C_D003000-induced D_D001919. This experiment is discussed with regard to the hypothesis that ultrasound production is the acoustic by-product of a physiological maneuver that compensates for C_D003000's detrimental effects on cardiovascular function.

title:Differential effects of systemically administered C_D007649 and C_D008012 on dynamic and static D_D006930 induced by intradermal C_D002211 in humans.
abstract:We have examined the effect of systemic administration of C_D007649 and C_D008012 on brush-evoked (dynamic) D_D010146 and punctate-evoked (static) D_D006930 induced by C_D002211. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, we studied 12 volunteers in three experiments. C_D002211 100 micrograms was injected intradermally on the volar forearm followed by an i.v. infusion of C_D007649 (bolus 0.1 mg kg-1 over 10 min followed by infusion of 7 micrograms kg-1 min-1), C_D008012 5 mg kg-1 or saline for 50 min. Infusion started 15 min after injection of C_D002211. The following were measured: spontaneous D_D010146, D_D010146 evoked by punctate and brush stimuli (VAS), and areas of brush-evoked and punctate-evoked D_D006930. C_D007649 reduced both the area of brush-evoked and punctate-evoked D_D006930 significantly and it tended to reduce brush-evoked D_D010146. C_D008012 reduced the area of punctate-evoked D_D006930 significantly. It tended to reduce VAS scores of spontaneous D_D010146 but had no effect on evoked D_D010146. The differential effects of C_D007649 and C_D008012 on static and dynamic D_D006930 suggest that the two types of D_D006930 are mediated by separate mechanisms and have a distinct pharmacology.

title:C_D016572 and C_D016559-associated D_D057049.
abstract:The development of D_D057049 (D_D057049) associated with the use of C_D016572 has been well documented. Treatments have included discontinuation or reduction of C_D016572 dose with or without concurrent plasma exchange, plasma infusion, anticoagulation, and intravenous immunoglobulin G infusion. However, for recipients of organ transplantation, removing the inciting agent is not without the attendant risk of precipitating acute rejection and graft loss. The last decade has seen the emergence of C_D016559 as a potent immunosuppressive agent with mechanisms of action virtually identical to those of C_D016572. As a result, switching to C_D016559 has been reported to be a viable therapeutic option in the setting of C_D016572-induced D_D057049. With the more widespread application of C_D016559 in organ transplantation, C_D016559-associated D_D057049 has also been recognized. However, literature regarding the incidence of the recurrence of D_D057049 in patients exposed sequentially to C_D016572 and C_D016559 is limited. We report a case of a living donor renal transplant recipient who developed C_D016572-induced D_D057049 that responded to the withdrawal of C_D016572 in conjunction with plasmapheresis and fresh frozen plasma replacement therapy. Introduction of C_D016559 as an alternative immunosuppressive agent resulted in the recurrence of D_D057049 and the subsequent loss of the renal allograft. Patients who are switched from C_D016572 to C_D016559 or vice versa should be closely monitored for the signs and symptoms of recurrent D_D057049.

title:Repeated transient D_D001002 following C_D019808 administration in a patient with a solitary kidney.
abstract:We report the case of a 70-year-old D_D006973 man with a solitary kidney and D_D051436 who developed two episodes of transient D_D001002 after C_D019808 administration. He was hospitalized for a D_D009203 with D_D011654, treated with high-dose diuretics. Due to severe D_D006331 C_D019808 was prescribed. Surprisingly, the first dose of 50 mg of C_D019808 resulted in a sudden D_D001002, which lasted eight hours despite high-dose C_D005665 and C_D000588 infusion. One week later, by mistake, C_D019808 was prescribed again and after the second dose of 50 mg, the patient developed a second episode of transient D_D001002 lasting 10 hours. During these two episodes, his blood pressure diminished but no severe D_D007022 was noted. Ultimately, an arteriography showed a 70-80% D_D012078. In this patient, D_D012078 combined with D_D006333 and diuretic therapy certainly resulted in a strong activation of the renin-C_D000809 system (RAS). Under such conditions, C_D000809 II receptor blockade by C_D019808 probably induced a critical fall in glomerular filtration pressure. This case report highlights the fact that the C_D000809 II receptor antagonist C_D019808 can cause serious unexpected complications in patients with D_D014652 and should be used with extreme caution in this setting.

title:In vivo protection of dna damage associated apoptotic and D_D009336 cell deaths during C_D000082-induced D_D007674, C_D000638-induced D_D008171 and C_D004317-induced D_D066126 by a novel C_C511402.
abstract:C_C511402, primarily a mixture of C_D044945, has been shown to modulate a wide-range of biological, pharmacological and toxicological effects which are mainly cytoprotective. This study assessed the ability of C_C511402 (C_C511402) to prevent C_D000082 (C_D000082)-induced D_D007674, C_D000638 (C_D000638)-induced D_D008171, and C_D004317 (C_D004317)-induced D_D066126 in mice. Experimental design consisted of four groups: control (vehicle alone), C_C511402 alone, drug alone and C_C511402+drug. For the cytoprotection study, animals were orally gavaged 100 mg/Kg C_C511402 for 7-10 days followed by i.p. injections of organ specific three drugs (C_D000082: 500 mg/Kg for 24 h; C_D000638: 50 mg/Kg/day for four days; C_D004317: 20 mg/Kg for 48 h). Parameters of study included analysis of serum chemistry (ALT, BUN and CPK), and orderly fragmentation of genomic DNA (both endonuclease-dependent and independent) in addition to microscopic evaluation of damage and/or protection in corresponding PAS stained tissues. Results indicate that C_C511402 preexposure prior to C_D000082, C_D000638 and C_D004317, provided near complete protection in terms of serum chemistry changes (ALT, BUN and CPK), and significantly reduced DNA fragmentation. Histopathological examination of kidney, heart and lung sections revealed moderate to massive D_D017695 with a variety of morphological aberrations by all the three drugs in the absence of C_C511402 preexposure than in its presence. C_C511402+drug exposed tissues exhibited minor residual damage or near total recovery. Additionally, histopathological alterations mirrored both serum chemistry changes and the pattern of DNA fragmentation. Interestingly, all the drugs, such as, C_D000082, C_D000638 and C_D004317 induced apoptotic death in addition to D_D009336 in the respective organs which was very effectively blocked by C_C511402. Since C_D000082, C_D000638 and C_D004317 undergo biotransformation and are known to produce damaging radicals in vivo, the protection by C_C511402 may be linked to both inhibition of metabolism and/or detoxification of cytotoxic radicals. In addition, its' presumed contribution to DNA repair may be another important attribute, which played a role in the chemoprevention process. Additionally, this may have been the first report on C_D000638-induced apoptotic death in the lung tissue. Taken together, these events undoubtedly establish C_C511402's abundant bioavailability, and the power to defend multiple target organs from toxic assaults induced by structurally diverse and functionally different entities in vivo.

title:D_D004409 in a D_D003866 adolescent on C_D015283.
abstract:Current estimates suggest that between 0.4% and 8.3% of children and adolescents are affected by D_D003865. We report a favorable response to treatment with C_D015283 by a 15-year-old boy with D_D003865 who exhibited D_D004409 during his first 2 weeks of treatment. This may have been a side effect of C_D015283 as it remitted with redistribution of doses.

title:C_D004177 potentiates C_D009020 antinociception but not D_D003248 after chronic treatment.
abstract:This work evaluates the antinociceptive and D_D003248 effects of the combination of 3.2 mg/kg s.c. C_D009020 with 177.8 mg/kg s.c. C_D004177 in acutely and chronically treated (once a day for 12 days) rats. On the 13th day, antinociceptive effects were assessed using a model of inflammatory nociception, D_D010146-induced functional impairment model, and the C_D002606 meal test was used to evaluate the intestinal transit. Simultaneous administration of C_D009020 with C_D004177 resulted in a markedly antinociceptive potentiation and an increasing of the duration of action after a single (298+/-7 vs. 139+/-36 units area (ua); P<0.001) and repeated administration (280+/-17 vs. 131+/-22 ua; P<0.001). Antinociceptive effect of C_D009020 was reduced in chronically treated rats (39+/-10 vs. 18+/-5 au) while the combination-induced antinociception was remained similar as an acute treatment (298+/-7 vs. 280+/-17 au). Acute antinociceptive effects of the combination were partially prevented by 3.2 mg/kg C_D009270 s.c. (P<0.05), suggesting the partial involvement of the opioidergic system in the synergism observed. In independent groups, C_D009020 inhibited the intestinal transit in 48+/-4% and 38+/-4% after acute and chronic treatment, respectively, suggesting that tolerance did not develop to the D_D003248 effects. The combination inhibited intestinal transit similar to that produced by C_D009020 regardless of the time of treatment, suggesting that C_D004177 did not potentiate C_D009020-induced D_D003248. These findings show a significant interaction between C_D009020 and C_D004177 in chronically treated rats, suggesting that this combination could be useful for the treatment of chronic D_D010146.

title:C_D007069 D_D001927 presenting with D_D020820.
abstract:CNS toxic effects of the antineoplastic agent C_D007069 (C_D007069) are frequent and include a variety of neurological symptoms that can limit drug use. We report a case of a 51-year-old man who developed severe, disabling negative D_D009207 of the upper and lower extremities after the infusion of C_D007069 for D_D010954. He was awake, revealed no changes of mental status and at rest there were no further motor symptoms. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging and extensive laboratory studies failed to reveal D_D001927 and D_D008659. An electroencephalogram showed continuous, generalized irregular slowing with admixed periodic triphasic waves indicating symptomatic D_D001927. The administration of C_D007069 was discontinued and within 12 h the D_D020820 resolved completely. In the patient described, the presence of D_D020820 during infusion of C_D007069, normal laboratory findings and imaging studies and the resolution of symptoms following the discontinuation of the drug suggest that negative D_D009207 is associated with the use of C_D007069.

title:Sub-chronic low dose C_D020888 (C_D020888) inhibits C_D003042-induced increases in nucleus accumbens C_D004298.
abstract:RATIONALE: C_D020888 (C_D020888) irreversibly inhibits C_D005680-transaminase. This non-receptor mediated inhibition requires de novo synthesis for restoration of functional C_D005680 catabolism. OBJECTIVES: Given its preclinical success for treating D_D019966 and the increased risk of D_D005128 (D_D005128) associated with cumulative lifetime exposure, we explored the effects of sub-chronic low dose C_D020888 on C_D003042-induced increases in nucleus accumbens (NAcc) C_D004298 (C_D004298). METHODS: Using in vivo microdialysis, we compared acute exposure (450 mg/kg) to an identical sub-chronic exposure (150 mg/kg per day for 3 days), followed by 1- or 3-day washout. Finally, we examined the low dose of 150 mg/kg (50 mg/kg per day) using a similar washout period. RESULTS: Sub-chronic C_D020888 exposure inhibited the effect of C_D003042 for 3 days, which exceeded in magnitude and duration the identical acute dose. CONCLUSIONS: Sub-chronic low dose C_D020888 potentiates and extends the inhibition of C_D003042-induced increases in C_D004298, effectively reducing cumulative exposures and the risk for D_D005128S.

title:Amount of D_D006470 and D_D006406 size in the collagenase-induced D_D002543 rat model.
abstract:The aggravated risk on D_D002543 (D_D002543) with drugs used for D_D020521 patients should be estimated carefully. We therefore established sensitive quantification methods and provided a rat D_D002543 model for detection of D_D002543 deterioration. In D_D002543 intrastriatally induced by 0.014-unit, 0.070-unit, and 0.350-unit collagenase, the amount of D_D006470 was measured using a hemoglobin assay developed in the present study and was compared with the morphologically determined D_D006406 volume. The blood amounts and D_D006406 volumes were significantly correlated, and the D_D006406 induced by 0.014-unit collagenase was adequate to detect D_D002543 deterioration. In D_D002543 induction using 0.014-unit collagenase, C_D006493 enhanced the D_D006406 volume 3.4-fold over that seen in control D_D002543 animals and the D_D006470 7.6-fold. Data suggest that this sensitive hemoglobin assay is useful for D_D002543 detection, and that a model with a small D_D002543 induced with a low-dose collagenase should be used for evaluation of drugs that may affect D_D002543.

title:C_D004958 reduces D_D012640-induced D_D001930 in ovariectomized female but not in male rats.
abstract:Estrogens protect ovariectomized rats from D_D001930 induced by C_D007608-induced D_D013226 (D_D013226). We compared the effects of C_D004958 in adult male and ovariectomized female rats subjected to C_D008094-C_D010862-induced D_D013226. Rats received subcutaneous injections of C_D004958 (2 microg/rat) or oil once daily for four consecutive days. D_D013226 was induced 20 h following the second injection and terminated 3 h later. The extent of C_D012834-stained CA3 and CA1 hippocampal neurons was evaluated 2 days after D_D013226. 17beta-C_D004958 did not alter the onset of first clonus in ovariectomized rats but accelerated it in males. 17beta-C_D004958 reduced the argyrophilic neurons in the CA1 and CA3-C sectors of ovariectomized rats. In males, C_D004958 increased the total damage score. These findings suggest that the effects of C_D004958 on D_D012640 threshold and damage may be altered by sex-related differences in the hormonal environment.

title:D_D003693 during C_D003024 treatment: incidence and associated risk factors.
abstract:BACKGROUND: Incidence and risk factors for D_D003693 during C_D003024 treatment require further clarification. METHODS: We used computerized pharmacy records to identify all adult D_D001523 inpatients treated with C_D003024 (1995-96), reviewed their medical records to score incidence and severity of D_D003693, and tested associations with potential risk factors. RESULTS: Subjects (n = 139) were 72 women and 67 men, aged 40.8 +/- 12.1 years, hospitalized for 24.9 +/- 23.3 days, and given C_D003024, gradually increased to an average daily dose of 282 +/- 203 mg (3.45 +/- 2.45 mg/kg) for 18.9 +/- 16.4 days. D_D003693 was diagnosed in 14 (10.1 % incidence, or 1.48 cases/person-years of exposure); 71.4 % of cases were moderate or severe. Associated factors were co-treatment with other centrally antimuscarinic agents, poor clinical outcome, older age, and longer hospitalization (by 17.5 days, increasing cost); sex, diagnosis or medical co-morbidity, and daily C_D003024 dose, which fell with age, were unrelated. CONCLUSIONS: D_D003693 was found in 10 % of C_D003024-treated inpatients, particularly in older patients exposed to other central anticholinergics. D_D003693 was inconsistently recognized clinically in milder cases and was associated with increased length-of-stay and higher costs, and inferior clinical outcome.

Few days later, the patient used another 200 mg C_D007654 tablet, and within an hour experienced a similar clinical picture, which resolved again spontaneously within hours. Laboratory evaluations, including head CT scan, were normal. This case illustrates the need for close vigilance in D_D064420, particularly in the elderly.

title:Noxious chemical stimulation of rat facial mucosa increases intracranial blood flow through a trigemino-parasympathetic reflex--an experimental model for D_D002561 in D_D003027.
abstract:D_D003027 is characterized by typical autonomic dysfunctions including facial and D_D002561. Both the trigeminal and the cranial parasympathetic systems may be involved in mediating these dysfunctions. An experimental model was developed in the rat to measure changes in lacrimation and intracranial blood flow following noxious chemical stimulation of facial mucosa. Blood flow was monitored in arteries of the exposed cranial dura mater and the parietal cortex using laser Doppler flowmetry. C_D002211 (0.01-1 mm) applied to oral or nasal mucosa induced D_D006940 and provoked lacrimation. These responses were blocked by systemic pre-administration of C_D018738 (20 mg/kg). The evoked D_D006940 were also abolished by topical pre-administration of C_D001285 (1 mm) and [Lys1, Pro2,5, Arg3,4, Tyr6]-VIP (0.1 mm), a vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) antagonist, onto the exposed dura mater. We conclude that noxious stimulation of facial mucosa increases intracranial blood flow and lacrimation via a trigemino-parasympathetic reflex. The blood flow responses seem to be mediated by the release of C_D000109 and VIP within the meninges. Similar mechanisms may be involved in the pathogenesis of D_D003027.

title:Recurrent excitation in the dentate gyrus of a murine model of D_D004833.
abstract:Similar to rats, systemic C_D010862 injection causes D_D013226 (D_D013226) and the eventual development of spontaneous D_D012640 and mossy fiber sprouting in C57BL/6 and CD1 mice, but the physiological correlates of these events have not been identified in mice. Population responses in granule cells of the dentate gyrus were examined in transverse slices of the ventral hippocampus from C_D010862-treated and untreated mice. In C_D008274(2+)-free bathing medium containing C_D001640, conditions designed to increase excitability in the slices, electrical stimulation of the hilus resulted in a single population spike in granule cells from control mice and C_D010862-treated mice that did not experience D_D013226. In D_D013226 survivors, similar stimulation resulted in a population spike followed, at a variable latency, by negative DC shifts and repetitive afterdischarges of 3-60 s duration, which were blocked by ionotropic C_D018698 receptor antagonists. Focal C_D018698 photostimulation of the granule cell layer at sites distant from the recording pipette resulted in population responses of 1-30 s duration in slices from D_D013226 survivors but not other groups. These data support the hypothesis that D_D013226-induced mossy fiber sprouting and synaptic reorganization are relevant characteristics of D_D012640 development in these murine strains, resembling rat models of human D_D004833.

title:The alpha3 and beta4 nicotinic C_D000109 receptor subunits are necessary for C_D009538-induced D_D012640 and D_D006948 in mice.
abstract:Binding of C_D009538 to nicotinic C_D000109 receptors (nAChRs) elicits a series of dose-dependent behaviors that go from altered exploration, sedation, and D_D014202, to D_D012640 and D_D003643. nAChRs are pentameric ion channels usually composed of alpha and beta subunits. A gene cluster comprises the alpha3, alpha5 and beta4 subunits, which coassemble to form functional receptors. We examined the role of the beta4 subunits in C_D009538-induced D_D012640 and D_D006948 in beta4 homozygous null (beta4 -/-) and alpha3 heterozygous (+/-) mice. beta4 -/- mice were less sensitive to the effects of C_D009538 both at low doses, measured as decreased exploration in an open field, and at high doses, measured as sensitivity to C_D009538-induced D_D012640. Using in situ hybridization probes for the alpha3 and alpha5 subunits, we showed that alpha5 mRNA levels are unchanged, whereas alpha3 mRNA levels are selectively decreased in the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb, and the inferior and the superior colliculus of beta4 -/- brains. alpha3 +/- mice were partially resistant to C_D009538-induced D_D012640 when compared to wild-type littermates. mRNA levels for the alpha5 and the beta4 subunits were unchanged in alpha3 +/- brains. Together, these results suggest that the beta4 and the alpha3 subunits are mediators of C_D009538-induced D_D012640 and D_D006948.

The second episode was more severe than the first; and although both were treated with intensive corticosteroid therapy, renal function remained impaired. Although most cases of antibiotic induced acute D_D009395 are benign and self-limited, some patients are at risk for permanent D_D007674.

abstract:C_D014635-induced D_D001927 is a rare syndrome that may manifest in otherwise normal D_D004827 individuals. It may even present in patients who have tolerated this medicine well in the past. It is usually but not necessarily associated with D_D022124. The EEG shows characteristic triphasic waves in most patients with this complication. A case of C_D014635-induced D_D001927 is presented.

title:C_D019331: a potential protector against C_D005839 D_D006311.
abstract:The C_D009569 (C_D009569) inhibitor C_D019331 (C_D019331) may act as an otoprotectant against D_D006316 caused by C_D005839, but further studies are needed to confirm this.C_D000617 antibiotics are still widely used by virtue of their efficacy and low cost. Their D_D006311 is a serious health problem and, as their D_D006311 mechanism involves the production of C_D009569, we need to assess the use of C_D009569 inhibitors for the prevention of C_D000617-induced D_D006319. In this experimental study we used 30 Sprague-Dawley rats, 27 of which had C_D005839 instilled into the middle ear. The otoprotectant C_D019331 was administered topically to 12/27 animals. Its effect was determined in terms of attenuation of D_D034381, measured by shifts in the auditory brainstem response threshold. C_D019331 reduced C_D005839-induced D_D034381 in the high-frequency range, but gave no protection in the middle or low frequencies.

title:D_D020293 following oral C_D008774 intake in an adult: a case report.
abstract:C_D008774 is structurally and functionally similar to C_D000661. D_D020293 associated with C_D000661 abuse is well documented, and in rare cases D_D002544 has been reported after C_D008774 intake in children. We report the case of a 63-year-old female who was treated with C_D008774 due to D_D006948 and suffered from multiple D_D002544s. We consider drug-induced D_D020293 as the most likely cause of recurrent D_D002544s in the absence of any pathological findings during the diagnostic work-up. We conclude that C_D008774 mediated D_D014657 should be considered in patients with neurological symptoms and a history of C_D008774 therapy. This potential side-effect, though very rare, represents one more reason to be very restrictive in the use of C_D008774.

title:D_D002543 induced by C_D014859 - the influence of drug-drug interactions.
abstract:PURPOSE: To evaluate the frequency, severity and preventability of C_D014859-induced D_D002543 due to C_D014859 and C_D014859-drug interactions in patients living in the county of Osterg  tland, Sweden. METHODS: All patients with a diagnosed D_D002543 at three hospitals during the period 2000-2002 were identified. Medical records were studied retrospectively to evaluate whether C_D014859 and C_D014859-drug interactions could have caused the D_D002543. The proportion of possibly avoidable cases due to drug interactions was estimated. RESULTS: Among 593 patients with D_D002543, 59 (10%) were assessed as related to C_D014859 treatment. This imply an incidence of 1.7/100,000 treatment years. Of the 59 cases, 26 (44%) had a fatal outcome, compared to 136 (25%) among the non-C_D014859 patients (p < 0.01). A C_D014859-drug interaction could have contributed to the D_D006470 in 24 (41%) of the C_D014859 patients and in 7 of these (12%) the D_D006470 complication was considered being possible to avoid. CONCLUSIONS: C_D014859-induced D_D002543 are a major clinical problem with a high fatality rate. Almost half of the cases was related to a C_D014859-drug interaction. A significant proportion of C_D014859-related D_D002543 might have been prevented if greater caution had been taken when prescribing drugs known to interact with C_D014859.

title:Side effects of postoperative administration of C_D008775 and C_D005839 into the posterior sub-Tenon's space.
abstract:PURPOSE: To assess the incidence of postoperative emetic side effects after the administration of C_D008775 and C_D005839 into the posterior sub-Tenon's space at the end of routine D_D002386 surgery. SETTING: St. Luke's Hospital, Gwardamangia, Malta. METHODS: A double-blind double-armed prospective study comprised 40 patients who had uneventful sutureless phacoemulsification under sub-Tenon's local infiltration of 3 mL of plain C_D008012. At the end of the procedure, Group A (n = 20) had 20 mg/0.5 mL of C_D008775 and 10 mg/0.5 mL of C_D005839 injected into the posterior sub-Tenon's space and Group B (n = 20) had the same combination injected into the anterior sub-Tenon's space. Postoperatively, all patients were assessed for symptoms of D_D020250, and D_D006261. A chi-square test was used to assess the statistical significance of results. RESULTS: Sixty percent in Group A developed D_D020250, D_D006261, or both; 1 patient in Group B developed symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of C_D008775 and C_D005839 in the posterior sub-Tenon's space was related to a high incidence of side effects including D_D020250, and D_D006261. All adverse effects were self-limiting.

title:Cardiac Angiography in Renally Impaired Patients (CARE) study: a randomized double-blind trial of contrast-induced D_D007674 in patients with D_D051436.
abstract:BACKGROUND: No direct comparisons exist of the renal tolerability of the low-osmolality C_D003287 C_D007479 with that of the iso-osmolality C_D003287 C_C044834 in high-risk patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: The present study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind comparison of C_D007479 and C_C044834 in patients with D_D051436 (estimated glomerular filtration rate, 20 to 59 mL/min) who underwent cardiac angiography or percutaneous coronary interventions. Serum C_D003404 (SCr) levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate were assessed at baseline and 2 to 5 days after receiving medications. The primary outcome was a postdose SCr increase > or = 0.5 mg/dL (44.2 micromol/L) over baseline. Secondary outcomes were a postdose SCr increase > or = 25%, a postdose estimated glomerular filtration rate decrease of > or = 25%, and the mean peak change in SCr. In 414 patients, contrast volume, presence of D_D003920, use of C_D000111, mean baseline SCr, and estimated glomerular filtration rate were comparable in the 2 groups. SCr increases > or = 0.5 mg/dL occurred in 4.4% (9 of 204 patients) after C_D007479 and 6.7% (14 of 210 patients) after C_C044834 (P=0.39), whereas rates of SCr increases > or = 25% were 9.8% and 12.4%, respectively (P=0.44). In patients with D_D003920, SCr increases > or = 0.5 mg/dL were 5.1% (4 of 78 patients) with C_D007479 and 13.0% (12 of 92 patients) with C_C044834 (P=0.11), whereas SCr increases > or = 25% were 10.3% and 15.2%, respectively (P=0.37). Mean post-SCr increases were significantly less with C_D007479 (all patients: 0.07 versus 0.12 mg/dL, 6.2 versus 10.6 micromol/L, P=0.03; patients with D_D003920: 0.07 versus 0.16 mg/dL, 6.2 versus 14.1 micromol/L, P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of contrast-induced D_D007674, defined by multiple end points, is not statistically different after the intraarterial administration of C_D007479 or C_C044834 to high-risk patients, with or without D_D003920. Any true difference between the agents is small and not likely to be clinically significant.

title:A novel compound, C_C524754, attenuates D_D003072 and shows neuroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo D_D003704 models.
abstract:To develop a novel and effective drug that could enhance cognitive function and neuroprotection, we newly synthesized C_C524754 by the esterification of C_C008316 and C_C032171. In the present study, we investigated whether C_C524754 could improve D_D003072 in C_D012601-injected rats and in C_C544092-infused rats. C_C524754 was found to attenuate D_D003072 in both rat models using passive avoidance test and to reduce apoptotic cell death observed in the hippocampus of the C_C544092-infused rats. We also examined the neuroprotective effects of C_C524754 in vitro using SH-SY5Y cells. Cells were pretreated with C_C524754, before exposed to C_C544092, C_D018698 or C_D006861. We found that C_C524754 significantly decreased apoptotic cell death and reduced reactive oxygen species, cytochrome c release, and caspase 3 activation. Taking these in vitro and in vivo results together, our study suggests that C_C524754 is a potentially effective candidate against D_D000544 that is characterized by wide spread D_D009410 and progressive D_D003072.

title:Interaction between C_D014859 and C_D064704: case series.
abstract:C_D014859 is the most widely used oral anticoagulant and is indicated for many clinical conditions. C_D064704, a C_D024841, is one of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics in clinical practice and is effective against Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and atypical bacteria. While small prospective studies have not revealed any significant drug-drug interaction between C_D014859 and C_D064704, several case reports have indicated that C_D064704 may significantly potentiate the anticoagulation effect of C_D014859. We report 3 cases of serious D_D006470 complications that appear to be the result of the interaction between C_D014859 and C_D064704. Physicians should be aware of this potential interaction and use caution when prescribing C_D064704 to patients taking C_D014859.

title:Mutations associated with C_D019259-resistance in therapy-C_D012964  ve D_D006509 patients with and without D_D015658: implications for antiretroviral therapy in HBV and HIV co-infected South African patients.
abstract:This was an exploratory study to investigate C_D019259-resistant D_D006509 virus (HBV) strains in selected C_D019259-C_D012964  ve HBV carriers with and without D_D015658 in South African patients. Thirty-five C_D019259-C_D012964  ve D_D006509 patients with or without D_D015658 were studied: 15 chronic D_D006509 patients and 20 HBV-HIV co-infected patients. The latter group was further sub-divided into 13 occult HBV (C_D006514-negative) and 7 overt HBV (C_D006514- positive) patients. C_D006514, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, and anti-HIV 1/2 were determined as part of routine diagnosis using Axsym assays (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL). Serum samples were PCR amplified with HBV reverse transcriptase (RT) primers, followed by direct sequencing across the C_D014443-C_D008715-C_D001224-C_D001224 (YMDD) motif of the major catalytic region in the C domain of the HBV RT enzyme. HBV viral load was performed with Amplicor HBV Monitor test v2.0 (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany). HBV C_D019259-resistant strains were detected in 3 of 15 mono-infected chronic D_D006509 patients and 10 of 20 HBV-HIV co-infected patients. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first report of HBV C_D019259-resistant strains in therapy-C_D012964  ve HBV-HIV co-infected patients. The HBV viral loads for mono-infected and co-infected patients ranged from 3.32 x 10(2) to 3.82 x 10(7) and <200 to 4.40 x 10(3) copies/ml, respectively. It remains to be seen whether such pre-existing antiviral mutations could result in widespread emergence of HBV resistant strains when C_D019259-containing highly active antiretroviral (ARV) treatment (HAART) regimens become widely applied in South Africa, as this is likely to have potential implications in the maC_D012964gement of HBV-HIV co-infected patients.

title:Sex differences in C_D016202 antagonist enhancement of C_D009020 antiD_D006930 in a C_D002211 model of persistent D_D010146: comparisons to two models of acute D_D010146.
abstract:In acute D_D010146 models, C_D016202 (C_D016202) antagonists enhance the antinociceptive effects of C_D009020 to a greater extent in males than females. The purpose of this investigation was to extend these findings to a persistent D_D010146 model which could be distinguished from acute D_D010146 models on the basis of the nociceptive fibers activated, neurochemical substrates, and duration of the nociceptive stimulus. To this end, persistent D_D006930 was induced by administration of C_D002211 in the tail of gonadally intact F344 rats, following which the tail was immersed in a mildly noxious thermal stimulus, and tail-withdrawal latencies measured. For comparison, tests were conducted in two acute D_D010146 models, the hotplate and warm water tail-withdrawal procedures. In males, the non-competitive C_D016202 antagonist C_D003915 enhanced the antihyperalgesic effect of low to moderate doses of C_D009020 in a dose-and time-dependent manner. Across the doses and pretreatment times examined, enhancement was not observed in females. Enhancement of C_D009020 antinociception by C_D003915 was seen in both males and females in the acute D_D010146 models, with the magnitude of this effect being greater in males. These findings demonstrate a sexually-dimorphic interaction between C_D016202 antagonists and C_D009020 in a persistent D_D010146 model that can be distinguished from those observed in acute D_D010146 models.

title:Development of D_D011507 after switch to C_D020123-based immunosuppression in long-term cardiac transplant patients.
abstract:Calcineurin-inhibitor therapy can lead to D_D007674 in heart transplantation patients. The novel immunosuppressive (IS) drug C_D020123 (C_D020123) lacks D_D007674 effects; however, D_D011507 associated with C_D020123 has been reported following renal transplantation. In cardiac transplantation, the incidence of D_D011507 associated with C_D020123 is unknown. In this study, long-term cardiac transplant patients were switched from C_D016572 to C_D020123-based IS. Concomitant IS consisted of C_C063008 +/- C_D013256. Proteinuria increased significantly from a median of 0.13 g/day (range 0-5.7) preswitch to 0.23 g/day (0-9.88) at 24 months postswitch (p = 0.0024). Before the switch, 11.5% of patients had high-grade D_D011507 (>1.0 g/day); this increased to 22.9% postswitch (p = 0.006). C_D000806 and C_D057911 (C_D057911) therapy reduced D_D011507 development. Patients without D_D011507 had increased renal function (median 42.5 vs. 64.1, p = 0.25), whereas patients who developed high-grade D_D011507 showed decreased renal function at the end of follow-up (median 39.6 vs. 29.2, p = 0.125). Thus, D_D011507 may develop in cardiac transplant patients after switch to C_D020123, which may have an adverse effect on renal function in these patients. C_D020123 should be used with C_D000806/C_D057911 therapy and patients monitored for D_D011507 and increased D_D007674.

title:C_D008694-induced D_D020258 and microglial activation are not mediated by fractalkine receptor signaling.
abstract:C_D008694 (C_D008694) damages C_D004298 (C_D004298) nerve endings by a process that has been linked to microglial activation but the signaling pathways that mediate this response have not yet been delineated. Cardona et al. [Nat. Neurosci. 9 (2006), 917] recently identified the microglial-specific fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) as an important mediator of C_D015632-induced D_D009422 of C_D004298 neurons. Because the D_D009422 caused by C_D008694 and C_D015632 is highly selective for the C_D004298 neuronal system in mouse models of D_D020258, we hypothesized that the CX3CR1 plays a role in C_D008694-induced D_D020258 and microglial activation. Mice in which the CX3CR1 gene has been deleted and replaced with a cDNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) were treated with C_D008694 and examined for striatal D_D020258. C_D008694 depleted C_D004298, caused microglial activation, and increased body temperature in CX3CR1 knockout mice to the same extent and over the same time course seen in wild-type controls. The effects of C_D008694 in CX3CR1 knockout mice were not gender-dependent and did not extend beyond the striatum. Striatal microglia expressing eGFP constitutively show morphological changes after C_D008694 that are characteristic of activation. This response was restricted to the striatum and contrasted sharply with unresponsive eGFP-microglia in surrounding brain areas that are not damaged by C_D008694. We conclude from these studies that CX3CR1 signaling does not modulate C_D008694 D_D020258 or microglial activation. Furthermore, it appears that striatal-resident microglia respond to C_D008694 with an activation cascade and then return to a surveying state without undergoing apoptosis or migration.

title:Recovery of C_D016559-associated D_D020968 after conversion to C_C107135 in a pediatric renal transplant recipient--case report and review of the literature.
abstract:C_D016559 has been shown to be a potent immunosuppressive agent for solid organ transplantation in pediatrics. D_D020258 is a potentially serious toxic effect. It is characterized by D_D001927, D_D006261, D_D012640, or D_D009461. Here, we describe an eight-and-a-half-yr-old male renal transplant recipient with right BN. MRI demonstrated hyperintense T2 signals in the cervical cord and right brachial plexus roots indicative of both D_D009187 and right D_D020968. Symptoms persisted for three months despite C_D016559 dose reduction, administration of IVIG and four doses of C_D008775 pulse therapy. Improvement and eventually full recovery only occurred after C_D016559 was completely discontinued and successfully replaced by C_C107135.

title:D_D006349 in patients with D_D010300 treated with C_D010479. Course following treatment modifications.
abstract:D_D006349 have been reported in patients with D_D010300 (D_D010300) treated with C_D010479. However, the incidence and severity of these abnormalities vary from study to study and their course after drug withdrawal has not been systematically assessed. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the frequency and severity of D_D006349 and its possible reversibility after drug withdrawal in a case-control study. METHODS: All D_D010300 patients in the Amiens area treated with C_D010479 were invited to attend a cardiologic assessment including transthoracic echocardiography. Thirty D_D010300 patients participated in the study. A second echocardiography was performed (median interval: 13 months) after C_D010479 withdrawal (n=10 patients). Controls were age- and sex-matched non-D_D010300 patients referred to the cardiology department. RESULTS: Compared to controls, D_D001022 (OR: 3.1; 95% IC: 1.1-8.8) and D_D008944 (OR: 10.7; 95% IC: 2.1-53) were more frequent in D_D010300 patients (tricuspid: NS). The number of affected valves (n=2.4+/-0.7) and the sum of regurgitation grades (n=2.8+/-1.09) were higher (p=0.008 and p=0.006, respectively) in the C_D010479 group. Severity of regurgitation was not correlated with C_D010479 cumulative dose. A restrictive pattern of D_D006349, suggestive of the role of C_D010479, was observed in 12/30 (40%) patients including two with D_D006333. C_D010479 was discontinued in 10 patients with D_D006349, resulting in a lower regurgitation grade (p=0.01) at the second transthoracic echocardiography and the two patients with D_D006333 returned to nearly normal clinical examination. This study supports the high frequency of restrictive D_D006349 in D_D010300 patients treated with C_D010479 and reveals that a significant improvement is usual when the treatment is converted to non-ergot C_D004298 agonists.

title:Adverse effects of topical C_D010208 on auditory nerve function.
abstract:BACKGROUND: C_D010208 is a direct-acting vasodilator used to manage D_D020301 during various neurosurgical operations. Transient D_D003389 has been described in a few cases with topical C_D010208. This study supports previous reports and provides neurophysiological evidence of an adverse effect on the auditory nerve. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 70 consecutive microvascular decompression operations and studied those patients who received topical C_D010208 for D_D020301. Topical C_D010208 was used as a direct therapeutic action to manage D_D020301 in a total of 11 patients. The timing of C_D010208 application and ongoing operative events was reviewed relative to changes in neurophysiological recordings. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) were routinely used to monitor cochlear nerve function during these operations. FINDINGS: A temporal relationship was found between topical C_D010208 and BAEP changes leading to complete waveform loss. The average temporal delay between C_D010208 and the onset of an adverse BAEP change was 5 min. In 10 of 11 patients, BAEP waves II/III-V completely disappeared within 2 to 25 min after C_D010208. Eight of these 10 patients had complete loss of BAEP waveforms within 10 min. One patient showed no recovery of later waves and a delayed profound D_D006319. The average recovery time of BAEP waveforms to pre-C_D010208 baseline values was 39 min. CONCLUSIONS: Topical C_D010208 for the treatment of D_D020301 was associated with the onset of a transient disturbance in neurophysiological function of the ascending auditory brainstem pathway. The complete disappearance of BAEP waveforms with a consistent temporal delay suggests a possible D_D000160. Recommendations to avoid potential D_D003389 from C_D010208 are provided.

title:Massive D_D011507 and D_D058186 after oral C_D004164 (C_D019386) administration in a patient with D_D005923.
abstract:A 61-year-old Japanese man with D_D009404 due to D_D005923 was initially responding well to C_D013256 therapy. The amount of daily urinary protein decreased from 15.6 to 2.8 g. Within 14 days of the oral C_D004164 (C_D019386 sodium) administration, the amount of daily urinary protein increased rapidly up to 12.8 g with D_D058186. After discontinuing the oral C_D019386, the patient underwent six cycles of hemodialysis and four cycles of LDL apheresis. Urinary volume and serum C_D003404 levels recovered to the normal range, with urinary protein disappearing completely within 40 days. This report demonstrates that not only intravenous, but also oral C_D004164s can aggravate D_D011507 and D_D058186.

title:Serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 in C_D004317-induced D_D009404.
abstract:C_D004317-induced D_D007674 leads to epithelial C_D012964 channel (ENaC)-dependent D_D016055 and renal D_D005355. The C_D000450-sensitive serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase SGK1 has been shown to participate in the stimulation of ENaC and to mediate renal D_D005355 following mineralocorticoid and salt excess. The present study was performed to elucidate the role of SGK1 in the D_D016055 and D_D005355 during D_D009404. To this end, C_D004317 (15 mug/g body wt) was injected intravenously into gene-targeted mice lacking SGK1 (sgk1(-/-)) and their wild-type littermates (sgk1(+/+)). C_D004317 treatment resulted in heavy D_D011507 (>100 mg protein/mg crea) in 15/44 of sgk1(+/+) and 15/44 of sgk1(-/-) mice leading to severe D_D009404 with D_D001201, D_D006949, and D_D034141 in both genotypes. Plasma C_D000450 levels increased in D_D009404 mice of both genotypes and was followed by increased SGK1 protein expression in sgk1(+/+) mice. Urinary C_D012964 excretion reached signficantly lower values in sgk1(+/+) mice (15 +/- 5 mumol/mg crea) than in sgk1(-/-) mice (35 +/- 5 mumol/mg crea) and was associated with a significantly higher body D_D015430 in sgk1(+/+) compared with sgk1(-/-) mice (+6.6 +/- 0.7 vs. +4.1 +/- 0.8 g). During the course of D_D009404, serum C_D014508 concentrations increased significantly faster in sgk1(-/-) mice than in sgk1(+/+) mice leading to D_D014511 and a reduced median survival in sgk1(-/-) mice (29 vs. 40 days in sgk1(+/+) mice). In conclusion, gene-targeted mice lacking SGK1 showed blunted D_D016055, yet were not protected against renal D_D005355 during experimental D_D009404.

abstract:D_D011020 (D_D011020), a common D_D009894 in D_D015658 individuals, is generally treated with high doses of C_D015662. However, treatment is often limited by adverse effects. Here, we report two cases of severely immunocompromised D_D015658 patients who developed severe intrahepatic D_D002779, and in one patient lesions mimicking D_D008100 formation on radiologic exams, during C_D015662 treatment for D_D011020. Whereas patient 1 showed lesions of up to 1 cm readily detectable on magnetic resonance imaging under prolonged C_D015662 treatment, therapy of patient 2 was switched early.

title:Clinically significant D_D011507 following the administration of C_D020123 to renal transplant recipients.
abstract:BACKGROUND: C_D020123 is the latest immunosuppressive agent used to prevent rejection, and may have less D_D007674 than calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-based regimens. To date there has been little documentation of clinically significant D_D011507 linked with the use of C_D020123. We have encountered several patients who developed substantial D_D011507 associated with C_D020123 use. In each patient, the close temporal association between the commencement of C_D020123 therapy and D_D011507 implicated C_D020123 as the most likely etiology of the D_D011507. METHODS: We analyzed the clinical and laboratory information available for all 119 patients transplanted at the Washington Hospital Center between 1999-2003 for whom C_D020123 was a component of their immunosuppressant regimen. In these patients, the magnitude of D_D011507 was assessed on morning urine samples by turbidometric measurement or random urine protein:C_D003404 ratios, an estimate of grams of D_D011507/day. Laboratory results were compared between prior, during and following C_D020123 use. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (24%) developed increased D_D011507 from baseline during their post-transplantation course. In 21 patients an alternative cause of D_D011507 was either obvious or insufficient data was available to be conclusive. In 7 of the 28 patients there was a striking temporal association between the initiation of C_D020123 and the development of D_D009404-range D_D011507. D_D011507 correlated most strongly with C_D020123 therapy when compared to other demographic and clinical variables. In most patients, discontinuation of C_D020123 resulted in a decrease, but not resolution, of D_D011507. CONCLUSIONS: C_D020123 induces or aggravates pre-existing D_D011507 in an unpredictable subset of renal allograft recipients. D_D011507 may improve, but does not resolve, when C_D020123 is withdrawn.

title:Comparative cognitive and subjective side effects of immediate-release C_D010098 in healthy middle-aged and older adults.
abstract:This study measured the objective and subjective neurocognitive effects of a single 10-mg dose of immediate-release C_D010098 in healthy, older (> 65 years), and middle-aged (35 to 55 years) adults who were not suffering from chronic or significant daily D_D010146. Seventy-one participants completed 2 separate study days and were blind to medication condition (placebo, 10-mg C_D010098). Plasma C_D010098 concentration peaked between 60 and 90 minutes postdose (P < .01) and pupil size, an indication of physiological effects of the medication, peaked at approximately 90 to 120 minutes postdose (P < .01). Significant declines in simple and sustained attention, working memory, and verbal memory were observed at 1 hour postdose compared to baseline for both age groups with a trend toward return to baseline by 5 hours postdose. For almost all cognitive measures, there were no medication by age-interaction effects, which indicates that the 2 age groups exhibited similar responses to the medication challenge. This study suggests that for healthy older adults who are not suffering from chronic D_D010146, neurocognitive and pharmacodynamic changes in response to a 10-mg dose of immediate-release C_D010098 are similar to those observed for middle-aged adults. PERSPECTIVE: Study findings indicate that the metabolism, neurocognitive effects, and physical side effects of oral C_D010098 are similar for healthy middle-aged and older adults. Therefore, clinicians should not avoid prescribing oral opioids to older adults based on the belief that older adults are at higher risk for side effects than younger adults.

title:Normalizing effects of C_C048833 on sleep in chronic C_D003042 users.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of morning-dosed C_C048833 on sleep and D_D012893 in chronic C_D003042 users. METHOD: Twenty C_D003042-dependent participants were randomly assigned to receive C_C048833, 400 mg (N=10), or placebo (N=10) every morning at 7:30 a.m. for 16 days in an inpatient, double-blind randomized trial. Participants underwent polysomnographic sleep recordings on days 1 to 3, 7 to 9, and 14 to 16 (first, second, and third weeks of abstinence). The Multiple Sleep Latency Test was performed at 11:30 a.m., 2:00 p.m., and 4:30 p.m. on days 2, 8, and 15. For comparison of sleep architecture variables, 12 healthy comparison participants underwent a single night of experimental polysomnography that followed 1 night of accommodation polysomnography. RESULTS: Progressive abstinence from C_D003042 was associated with worsening of all measured polysomnographic sleep outcomes. Compared with placebo, C_C048833 decreased nighttime sleep latency and increased slow-wave sleep time in C_D003042-dependent participants. The effect of C_C048833 interacted with the abstinence week and was associated with longer total sleep time and shorter REM sleep latency in the third week of abstinence. Comparison of slow-wave sleep time, total sleep time, and sleep latency in C_D003042-dependent and healthy participants revealed a normalizing effect of C_C048833 in C_D003042-dependent participants. C_C048833 was associated with increased daytime sleep latency, as measured by the Multiple Sleep Latency Test, and a nearly significant decrease in subjective D_D012893. CONCLUSIONS: Morning-dosed C_C048833 promotes nocturnal sleep, normalizes sleep architecture, and decreases D_D012893 in abstinent C_D003042 users. These effects may be relevant in the treatment of C_D003042 dependence.

title:Efficacy and safety of C_C522667 in a placebo- and C_D006220-controlled trial in patients with acute exacerbation of D_D012559.
abstract:C_C522667 is approved by the Food and Drugs Administration in adults for acute treatment of D_D012559 or of D_D001714 or mixed episodes associated with D_D001714 with or without D_D011618 features. In a double-blind 6-week trial, 458 patients with acute D_D012559 were randomly assigned to fixed-dose treatment with C_C522667 at 5 mg twice daily (BID), C_C522667 at 10 mg BID, placebo, or C_D006220 at 4 mg BID (to verify assay sensitivity). With last observations carried forward (LOCF), mean Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score reductions from baseline to endpoint were significantly greater with C_C522667 at 5 mg BID (-16.2) and C_D006220 (-15.4) than placebo (-10.7; both P < 0.05); using mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM), changes at day 42 were significantly greater with C_C522667 at 5 and 10 mg BID (-21.3 and -19.4, respectively) and C_D006220 (-20.0) than placebo (-14.6; all P < 0.05). On the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale positive subscale, all treatments were superior to placebo with LOCF and MMRM; C_C522667 at 5 mg BID was superior to placebo on the negative subscale with MMRM and on the general psychopathology subscale with LOCF and MMRM. Treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in 44% and 52%, 57%, and 41% of the C_C522667 at 5 and 10 mg BID, C_D006220, and placebo groups, respectively. D_D001480 reported as AEs occurred in 15% and 18%, 34%, and 10% of the C_C522667 at 5 and 10 mg BID, C_D006220, and placebo groups, respectively. Across all groups, no more than 5% of patients had clinically significant weight change. Post hoc analyses indicated that efficacy was similar with C_C522667 and C_D006220; greater contrasts were seen in AEs, especially D_D001480.

title:Permeability, ultrastructural changes, and distribution of novel proteins in the glomerular barrier in early C_D011692 D_D009401.
abstract:BACKGROUND/AIMS: It is still unclear what happens in the glomerulus when D_D011507 starts. Using C_D011692 D_D009401 (PAN) rats, we studied early ultrastructural and permeability changes in relation to the expression of the podocyte-associated molecules nephrin, a-actinin, dendrin, and plekhh2, the last two of which were only recently discovered in podocytes. METHODS: Using immune stainings, semiquantitative measurement was performed under the electron microscope. Permeability was assessed using isolated kidney perfusion with tracers. Possible effects of ACE inhibition were tested. RESULTS: By day 2, some patchy foot process effacement, but no D_D011507, appeared. The amount of nephrin was reduced in both diseased and normal areas. The other proteins showed few changes, which were limited to diseased areas. By day 4, foot process effacement was complete and D_D011507 appeared in parallel with signs of size barrier damage. Nephrin decreased further, while dendrin and plekhh2 also decreased but a-actinin remained unchanged. ACE inhibition had no significant protective effect. CONCLUSIONS: PAN glomeruli already showed significant pathology by day 4, despite relatively mild D_D011507. This was preceded by altered nephrin expression, supporting its pivotal role in podocyte morphology. The novel proteins dendrin and plekhh2 were both reduced, suggesting roles in PAN, whereas a-actinin was unchanged.

title:Learning of rats under D_D000647 caused by C_D010424.
abstract:Dissociated learning of rats in the normal state and the state of D_D000647 produced by C_D010424 (15 mg/kg, ip) was carried out. Rats were trained to approach a shelf where they received food reinforcement. In Group 1 the rats were trained under the influence of C_D010424 to run to the same shelf as in the normal state. In Group 2 the rats were trained to approach different shelves in different drug states. It was shown that D_D008569 occurred in both groups. Differences in the parameters of training under the influence of C_D010424 between Groups 1 and 2 were revealed. These findings show that the brain-dissociated state induced by C_D010424 is formed with the participation of the mechanisms of information perception.

title:Role of C_D019820 oxidase in C_D003907-induced D_D006973 in rats.
abstract:1. Glucocorticoid-induced D_D006973 (GC-D_D006973) in the rat is associated with C_D009569-redox imbalance. 2. We studied the role of C_D019820 oxidase (XO), which is implicated in the production of reactive oxygen species, in C_D003907-induced D_D006973 (C_D003907-D_D006973). 3. Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly into four treatment groups: saline, C_D003907 (C_D003907), C_D000493 plus saline, and C_D000493 plus C_D003907. 4. Systolic blood pressures (SBP) and bodyweights were recorded each alternate day. Thymus weight was used as a marker of glucocorticoid activity, and serum C_D014527 to assess XO inhibition. 5. C_D003907 D_D006973 (110 +/- 2-126 +/- 3 mmHg; P < 0.001) and D_D015431 (P" < 0.01). C_D000493 decreased serum C_D014527 from 76 +/- 5 to 30 +/- 3 micromol/L (P < 0.001) in saline and from 84 +/- 13 to 28 +/- 2 micromol/L in C_D003907-treated (P < 0.01) groups. 6. C_D000493 did not prevent C_D003907-D_D006973. This, together with our previous findings that C_D000493 failed to prevent adrenocorticotrophic hormone induced D_D006973, suggests that XO activity is not a major determinant of GC-D_D006973 in the rat.

title:Extrapyramidal side effects with C_D018967 and C_D006220 at comparable D2 receptor occupancy levels.
abstract:C_D018967 is an antipsychotic drug with high affinity at C_D004298 D2 and C_D044348 receptors. Previous clinical studies have proposed that C_D018967's pharmacologic profile may produce improved efficacy for negative D_D011618 and decreased propensity for extrapyramidal side effects; features shared by so-called 'atypical' neuroleptics. To determine if routine C_D018967 treatment is associated with a unique degree of D2 receptor occupancy and pattern of clinical effects, we used [123I]IBZM SPECT to determine D2 occupancy in subjects treated with routine clinical doses of C_D018967 (n = 12) or C_D006220 (n = 7). Both C_D018967 and C_D006220 produced D2 occupancy levels between approximately 60 and 90% at standard clinical doses. There was no significant difference between occupancy levels obtained with C_D006220 or C_D018967. D_D010302 was observed in subjects treated with C_D018967 (42%) and C_D006220 (29%) and was observed at occupancy levels above 60%. Based on these observations, it is concluded that 5-HT2 blockade obtained with C_D018967 at D2 occupancy rates of 60% and above does not appear to protect against the risk for extrapyramidal side effects.

title:C_C492458-induced D_D017093 necessitating liver transplantation.
abstract:Abstract Serum aminotransferase elevations are a commonly known adverse effect of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (C_D019821) therapy. However, D_D056486 events have not been widely published with C_C108606 or the combination agent simvaC_D019821-C_C108606. We describe a 70-year-old Hispanic woman who developed fulminant D_D017093 necessitating liver transplantation 10 weeks after conversion from simvaC_D019821 40 mg/day to simvaC_D019821 10 mg-C_C108606 40 mg/day. The patient's lipid panel had been maintained with simvaC_D019821 for 18 months before the conversion without evidence of D_D056486ity. A routine laboratory work-up 10 weeks after conversion revealed elevated serum aminotransferase levels. SimvaC_D019821C_C108606 and C_D015283 (which she was taking for D_D003866) were discontinued, and other potential causes of D_D056486ity were excluded. A repeat work-up revealed further elevations in aminotransferase levels, and liver biopsy revealed evidence of moderate-to-severe D_D064420. She underwent liver transplantation with an uneventful postoperative course. Her aminotransferase levels returned to normal by postoperative day 23, and her 2-year follow-up showed no adverse events. C_C108606 undergoes extensive glucuronidation by C_D014530 glucoronosyltransferases (UGT) in the intestine and liver and may have inhibited the glucuronidation of simvaC_D019821 hydroxy acid, resulting in increased simvaC_D019821 exposure and subsequent D_D056486ity. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of simvaC_D019821-C_C108606-induced D_D017093 that resulted in liver transplantation. We postulate that the mechanism of the simvaC_D019821C_C108606-induced D_D056486ity is the increased simvaC_D019821 exposure by C_C108606 inhibition of UGT enzymes. Clinicians should be aware of potential D_D056486ity with simvaC_D019821-C_C108606 especially in elderly patients and should carefully monitor serum aminotransferase levels when starting therapy and titrating the dosage.

title:Oral manifestations of "D_-1": a case report.
abstract:AIM: The aim of the documentation of this clinical case is to make clinicians aware of "D_-1" and the medical risks associated with this serious condition. BACKGROUND: C_D008694 is a very addictive, powerful stimulant that increases wakefulness and physical activity and can produce other effects such as D_D001145, D_D006973, D_D006212, and D_D001523. Dental patients abusing C_D008694 can present with poor oral hygiene, D_D014987, rampant D_D003731 ("D_-1"), and excessive D_D057085. Oral rehabilitation of patients using C_D008694 can be challenging. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 30-year-old Caucasian woman presented with dental D_D010146, D_D012120, and self-reported poor esthetics. A comprehensive examination including her medical history, panoramic radiograph, and intraoral examination revealed 19 D_D003731, which is not very common for a healthy adult. She reported her use of C_D008694 for five years and had not experienced any major D_D003731 before she started using the drug. SUMMARY: The patient's medical and dental histories along with radiographic and clinical findings lead to a diagnosis of "D_-1." Although three different dental treatment modalities (either conventional or implant-supported) have been offered to the patient since August 2007, the patient has yet to initiate any treatment. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This clinical case showing oral manifestations of D_-1 was presented to help dental practitioners recognize and manage patients who may be abusing C_D008694s. Dental practitioners also may be skeptical about the reliability of appointment keeping by these patients, as they frequently miss their appointments without reasonable justification.

title:C_D013974 abuse: an unusual case of D_D013971 in pregnancy.
abstract:D_D001068 and the associated behavioural problems and D_D019966 are uncommon in pregnancy. When they do occur they are often unrecognized because of denial but when significant may pose a risk to both the mother and her fetus. This case illustrates a number of problems that may be encountered in women with D_D001068 in pregnancy, including prolonged and recurrent metabolic disturbances and diuretic abuse. In particular it illustrates the derangements of thyroid function seen in pregnant women with D_D001068 and reminds us that when a cause for D_D013971 remains obscure, C_D013974 abuse should be considered and explored.

title:Attenuation of C_D008694-induced nigrostriatal C_D004298rgic D_D020258 in mice by C_D008070 pretreatment.
abstract:Immunological activation has been proposed to play a role in C_D008694-induced D_D009422. In this study, we examined the roles of C_D008070, a pro-inflammatory and inflammatory factor, treatment in modulating the C_D008694-induced nigrostriatal C_D004298 D_D020258. C_D008070 pretreatment did not affect the basal body temperature or C_D008694-elicited D_D005334 three days later. Such systemic C_D008070 treatment mitigated C_D008694-induced striatal C_D004298 and C_D015102 depletions in a dose-dependent manner. As the most potent dose (1 mg/kg) of C_D008070 was administered two weeks, one day before or after the C_D008694 dosing regimen, C_D008694-induced striatal C_D004298 and C_D015102 depletions remained unaltered. Moreover, systemic C_D008070 pretreatment (1 mg/kg) attenuated local C_D008694 infusion-produced C_D004298 and C_D015102 depletions in the striatum, indicating that the protective effect of C_D008070 is less likely due to interrupted peripheral distribution or metabolism of C_D008694. We concluded a critical time window for systemic C_D008070 pretreatment in exerting effective protection against C_D008694-induced nigrostriatal C_D004298 D_D020258.

title:Effect of converting enzyme inhibition on the course of C_D004317-induced D_D007674.
abstract:The effect of the converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) C_D004656 was assessed in Munich-Wistar rats with established C_D004317 D_D009401. Rats were given a single dose of C_D004317 and one month later divided into four groups matched for D_D000419, blood pressure, and plasma albumin concentration. Groups 1 and 3 remained untreated while groups 2 and 4 received C_D004656. Groups 1 and 2 underwent micropuncture studies after 10 days. These short-term studies showed that C_D004656 reduced arterial blood pressure (101 +/- 2 vs. 124 +/- 3 mm Hg, group 2 vs. 1, P less than 0.05) and glomerular capillary pressure (54 +/- 1 vs. 61 +/- 2 mm Hg, P less than 0.05) without reducing D_D000419 (617 +/- 50 vs. 570 +/- 47 mg/day) or GFR (1.03 +/- 0.04 vs. 1.04 +/- 0.11 ml/min). Groups 3 and 4 were studied at four and at six months to assess the effect of C_D004656 on progression of D_D007674 in C_D004317 D_D009401. Chronic C_D004656 treatment reduced blood pressure without reducing D_D000419 in group 4. Untreated group 3 rats exhibited a progressive reduction in GFR (0.35 +/- 0.08 ml/min at 4 months, 0.27 +/- 0.07 ml/min at 6 months). C_D004656 treatment blunted but did not prevent reduction in GFR in group 4 (0.86 +/- 0.15 ml/min at 4 months, 0.69 +/- 0.13 ml/min at 6 months, both P less than 0.05 vs. group 3). Reduction in GFR was associated with the development of D_D007674 in both treated and untreated rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

title:Butyrylcholinesterase gene mutations in patients with prolonged D_D001049 after C_D013390 for electroconvulsive therapy.
abstract:BACKGROUND: patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) often receive C_D013390 as part of the anesthetic procedure. The duration of action may be prolonged in patients with genetic variants of the butyrylcholinesterase enzyme (BChE), the most common being the K- and the A-variants. The aim of the study was to assess the clinical significance of genetic variants in butyrylcholinesterase gene (BCHE) in patients with a suspected prolonged duration of action of C_D013390 after ECT. METHODS: a total of 13 patients were referred to the Danish Cholinesterase Research Unit after ECT during 38 months. We determined the BChE activity and the BCHE genotype using molecular genetic methods, the duration of D_D001049, time to sufficient spontaneous ventilation and whether neuromuscular monitoring was used. The duration of D_D001049 was compared with published data on normal subjects. RESULTS: in 11 patients, mutations were found in the BCHE gene, the K-variant being the most frequent. The duration of D_D001049 was 5-15 min compared with 3-5.3 min from the literature. Severe distress was noted in the recovery phase in two patients. Neuromuscular monitoring was used in two patients. CONCLUSION: eleven of 13 patients with a prolonged duration of action of C_D013390 had mutations in BCHE, indicating that this is the possible reason for a prolonged period of D_D001049. We recommend objective neuromuscular monitoring during the first ECT.

title:C_D007649 sedation for the reduction of children's D_D050723 in the emergency department.
abstract:BACKGROUND: There recently has been a resurgence in the utilization of C_D007649, a unique anesthetic, for emergency-department procedures requiring sedation. The purpose of the present study was to examine the safety and efficacy of C_D007649 for sedation in the treatment of children's D_D050723 in the emergency department. METHODS: One hundred and fourteen children (average age, 5.3 years; range, twelve months to ten years and ten months) who underwent closed reduction of an isolated D_D050723 or D_D004204 in the emergency department at a level-I D_D014947 center were prospectively evaluated. C_D007649 hydrochloride was administered intravenously (at a dose of two milligrams per kilogram of body weight) in ninety-nine of the patients and intramuscularly (at a dose of four milligrams per kilogram of body weight) in the other fifteen. A board-certified emergency physician skilled in airway management supervised administration of the anesthetic, and the patients were monitored by a registered nurse. Any D_D010146 during the reduction was rated by the orthopaedic surgeon treating the patient according to the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario D_D010146 Scale (CHEOPS). RESULTS: The average time from intravenous administration of C_D007649 to manipulation of the D_D050723 or D_D004204 was one minute and thirty-six seconds (range, twenty seconds to five minutes), and the average time from intramuscular administration to manipulation was four minutes and forty-two seconds (range, sixty seconds to fifteen minutes). The average score according to the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario D_D010146 Scale was 6.4 points (range, 5 to 10 points), reflecting minimal or no D_D010146 during D_D050723 reduction. Adequate D_D050723 reduction was obtained in 111 of the children. Ninety-nine percent (sixty-eight) of the sixty-nine parents present during the reduction were pleased with the sedation and would allow it to be used again in a similar situation. Patency of the airway and independent respiration were maintained in all of the patients. Blood pressure and heart rate remained stable. Minor side effects included D_D009325 (thirteen patients), D_D014839 (eight of the thirteen patients with D_D009325), D_D001259 (evident as D_D001259 in ten patients), and D_-1 (one patient). No long-term sequelae were noted, and no patients had D_D006212 or nightmares. CONCLUSIONS: C_D007649 reliably, safely, and quickly provided adequate sedation to effectively facilitate the reduction of children's D_D050723 in the emergency department at our institution. C_D007649 should only be used in an environment such as the emergency department, where proper one-on-one monitoring is used and board-certified physicians skilled in airway management are directly involved in the care of the patient.

title:Prophylactic use of C_D019259 with chronic immunosuppressive therapy for D_D012216.
abstract:The objective of this study was to report our experience concerning the effectiveness of the prophylactic administration of C_D019259 in C_D006514 (C_D006514) positive patients with D_D012216. From June 2004 to October 2006, 11 C_D006514 positive patients with D_D012216s, who were on both immunosuppressive and prophylactic C_D019259 therapies, were retrospectively assessed. Liver function tests, D_D006509 virus (HBV) serologic markers, and HBV DNA levels of the patients during follow-up were obtained from hospital file records. Eleven patients (six male) with median age 47 years (range 27-73), median disease duration 50 months (range 9-178) and median follow-up period of patients 13.8 months (range 5-27) were enrolled in this study. C_D019259 therapy was started 3-7 days prior to immunosuppressive therapy in all patients. Baseline, liver function tests were elevated in two patients (fourth patient: ALT:122 IU/l, AST:111 IU/l, tenth patient:ALT:294 IU/l, AST:274 IU/l, with minimal changes in the liver biopsy in both). Shortly after treatment their tests normalized and during follow-up period none of the patients had D_D056486 tests. In four patients HBV DNA levels were higher than normal at baseline. Two of these normalized and the others increased later. In three additional patients, HBV DNA levels were increased during follow-up. None of the patients had significant clinical sings of HBV activation. C_D019259 was well tolerated and was continued in all patients. Prophylactic administration of C_D019259 in patients who required immunosuppressive therapy seems to be safe, well tolerated and effective in preventing HBV reactivation.

title:Safety of transesophageal echocardiography in adults: study in a multidisciplinary hospital.
abstract:BACKGROUND: TEE is a semi-invasive tool broadly used and its utilization associated to sedatives drugs might to affect the procedure safety. OBJECTIVE: to analyze aspects of TEE safety associated to the use of C_D008874 (C_D008874) and C_D005442 (C_D005442) and the influence of the clinical variables on the event rate. METHOD: prospective study with 137 patients that underwent TEE with C_D008874 associated to moderate sedation. We analyzed the following events: complications related with the topical anesthesia, with C_D008874 use and with the procedure. Uni- and multivariate analyses were used to test the influence of the clinical variables: age, sex, D_D020521, D_D009202 (D_D009202), duration of the test, D_D008944 (D_D008944) and the C_D008874 dose. RESULTS: All patients (65+/-16 yrs; 58% males) finished the examination. The mean doses of C_D008874 and C_D005442 were 4.3+/-1.9 mg and 0.28+/-0.2 mg, respectively. The duration of the examination and the mean ejection fraction (EF) were 16.4+/-6.1 minutes and 60+/-9%, respectively. Mild D_D000860 (SO2<90%) was the most common event (11 patients); 3 patients (2%) presented transient D_D000860 due to upper D_D000402 by probe introduction and 8 (5.8%) due to D_D000860 caused by C_D008874 use. Transient D_D007022 (SAP<90mmHg) occurred in 1 patient (0.7%). The multivariate analysis showed that severe D_D008944, D_D009202 (EF<45%) and high doses of C_D008874 (>5mg) were associated with events (p<0.001). The EF was 40%, in the group with D_D009202 and 44% in the group with severe D_D008944 and it can be a factor associated with clinical events in the last group. CONCLUSION: TEE with sedation presents a low rate of events. There were no severe events and there was no need to interrupt the examinations.

title:Effects of C_D002118 channel blockers on C_D002045-induced D_D064420.
abstract:The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of C_D002118 channel blockers on C_D002045-induced acute D_D064420. For each of the three tested C_D002118 channel blockers (C_D004110, C_D014700 and C_D015764) 6 groups of mice were treated by two different doses, i.e. 2 and 10 mg/kg/i.p., or an equal volume of saline for the control group (n = 20); 15 minutes later, all the animals were injected with a single 50 mg/kg/i.p. dose of C_D002045. The convulsant activity, the time of latency to convulse and the mortality rate were assessed in each group. The local anesthetic-induced mortality was significantly increased by the three different C_D002118 channel blockers. The convulsant activity of C_D002045 was not significantly modified but C_D002118 channel blockers decreased the time of latency to obtain C_D002045-induced D_D012640; this effect was less pronounced with C_D015764.

title:C_D012642-induced D_D007024 in D_D010300: a longitudinal study on the effects of drug withdrawal.
abstract:OBJECTIVES: The United Kingdom D_D010300 Research Group (UKD_D010300RG) trial found an increased mortality in patients with D_D010300 (D_D010300) randomized to receive 10 mg C_D012642 per day and C_D007980 compared with those taking C_D007980 alone. Recently, we found that therapy with C_D012642 and C_D007980 was associated with selective D_D007024 which was abolished by withdrawal of C_D012642. This unwanted effect on postural blood pressure was not the result of underlying autonomic failure. The aims of this study were to confirm our previous findings in a separate cohort of patients and to determine the time course of the cardiovascular consequences of stopping C_D012642 in the expectation that this might shed light on the mechanisms by which the drug causes D_D007024. METHODS: The cardiovascular responses to standing and head-up tilt were studied repeatedly in D_D010300 patients receiving C_D012642 and as the drug was withdrawn. RESULTS: Head-up tilt caused D_D007024 which was marked in six of 20 D_D010300 patients on C_D012642, one of whom lost consciousness with unrecordable blood pressures. A lesser degree of D_D007024 occurred with standing. D_D007024 was ameliorated 4 days after withdrawal of C_D012642 and totally abolished 7 days after discontinuation of the drug. Stopping C_D012642 also significantly D_D007024 consistent with a previously undescribed supine pressor action. CONCLUSION: This study confirms our previous finding that C_D012642 in combination with C_D007980 is associated with selective D_D007024. The possibilities that these cardiovascular findings might be the result of non-selective inhibition of monoamine oxidase or of C_D000661 and metC_D000661 are discussed.

title:Explicit episodic memory for sensory-discriminative components of C_D002211-induced D_D010146: immediate and delayed ratings.
abstract:D_D010146 memory is thought to affect future D_D010146 sensitivity and thus contribute to clinical D_D010146 conditions. Systematic investigations of the human capacity to remember sensory features of experimental D_D010146 are sparse. In order to address long-term D_D010146 memory, nine healthy male volunteers received intradermal injections of three doses of C_D002211 (0.05, 1 and 20 microg, separated by 15 min breaks), each given three times in a balanced design across three sessions at one week intervals. D_D010146 rating was performed using a computerized visual analogue scale (0-100) digitized at 1/s, either immediately online or one hour or one day after injection. Subjects also recalled their D_D010146s one week later. C_D002211 injection reliably induced a dose-dependent flare (p<0.001) without any difference within or across sessions. The strong burning D_D010146 decayed exponentially within a few minutes. Subjects were able to reliably discriminate D_D010146 magnitude and duration across C_D002211 doses (both p<0.001), regardless of whether first-time ratings were requested immediately, after one hour or after one day. D_D010146 recall after one week was similarly precise (magnitude: p<0.01, duration: p<0.05). Correlation with rating recall after one week was best when first-time ratings were requested as late as one day after injection (R(2)=0.79) indicating that both rating retrievals utilized similar memory traces. These results indicate a reliable memory for magnitude and duration of experimentally induced D_D010146. The data further suggest that the consolidation of this memory is an important interim stage, and may take up to one day.

abstract:We report a case of severe D_D006973 with an occluded renal artery to a solitary kidney, who developed D_D058186 following treatment with C_D002216. His renal function remained impaired but stable during 2 years' treatment with C_D002216 but returned to pre-treatment levels soon after cessation of the drug. This indicates reversibility in C_D002216-induced D_D051437 even after its prolonged use and suggests that no organic damage occurs to glomerular arterioles following chronic ACE inhibition.

title:C_D002211-induced D_D063806 alters the excitability of the human jaw-stretch reflex.
abstract:The pathophysiology of D_D010146ful D_D013705 is not fully understood, but evidence suggests that D_D063806 modulates motor function in characteristic ways. This study tested the hypothesis that activation of D_D063806 afferent fibers would be linked to an increased excitability of the human jaw-stretch reflex and whether this process would be sensitive to length and velocity of the stretch. C_D002211 (10 micro g) was injected into the masseter muscle to induce D_D010146 in 11 healthy volunteers. Short-latency reflex responses were evoked in the masseter and temporalis muscles by a stretch device with different velocities and displacements before, during, and after the D_D010146. The normalized reflex amplitude increased with an increase in velocity at a given displacement, but remained constant with different displacements at a given velocity. The normalized reflex amplitude was significantly higher during D_D010146, but only at faster stretches in the D_D010146ful muscle. Increased sensitivity of the fusimotor system during acute D_D063806 could be one likely mechanism to explain the findings.

title:Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for C_D007980-induced D_D004409 in D_D010300.
abstract:In a placebo-controlled, single-blinded, crossover study, we assessed the effect of "real" repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) versus "sham" rTMS (placebo) on peak dose D_D004409 in patients with D_D010300 (D_D010300). Ten patients with D_D010300 and prominent D_D004409 had rTMS (1,800 pulses; 1 Hz rate) delivered over the motor cortex for 4 consecutive days twice, once real stimuli and once sham stimulation were used; evaluations were done at the baseline and 1 day after the end of each of the treatment series. Direct comparison between sham and real rTMS effects showed no significant difference in clinician-assessed D_D004409 severity. However, comparison with the baseline showed small but significant reduction in D_D004409 severity following real rTMS but not placebo. The major effect was on D_D004421 subscore. Similarly, in patient diaries, although both treatments caused reduction in subjective D_D004409 scores during the days of intervention, the effect was sustained for 3 days after the intervention for the real rTMS only. Following rTMS, no side effects and no adverse effects on motor function and D_D010300 symptoms were noted. The results suggest the existence of residual beneficial clinical aftereffects of consecutive daily applications of low-frequency rTMS on D_D004409 in D_D010300. The effects may be further exploited for potential therapeutic uses.

title:C_D004221-like syndrome after C_D003484 professional skin exposure: two case reports in France.
abstract:C_D003484 is a plant growth regulator used in agriculture to induce bud break in fruit trees. Contact with the skin can result in percutaneous absorption of the substance that inhibits C_D000079 dehydrogenase and can induce acetC_D000079 syndrome in case of C_D000431 use. The purpose of this report is to describe two cases of a C_D004221-like syndrome following occupational exposure to C_D003484. The first case involved a 59-year-old man who used C_D003484, which contains C_D003484, without protection after consuming a large amount of C_D000431 during a meal. In less than 1 hour after the ingestion of C_D000431, he developed malaise with D_D005483, D_D013610, and D_D004417. Manifestations regressed spontaneously under surveillance in the hospital. The second case occurred in a 55-year-old farmer following cutaneous contact with C_D003484. Five hours after exposure, he developed C_D004221-like syndrome with D_D005483, D_D013610, and D_D007022 after consuming three glasses of wine. The patient recovered spontaneously in 3 hours under surveillance in the hospital. These cases confirm the necessity of avoiding C_D000431 consumption as recommended in the instructions for use of C_D003484 and of preventing cutaneous contact during use.

title:Repeated C_D014299 induces C_D004298 D2/D3 and alpha1-adrenergic up-regulation.
abstract:C_D014299 (C_D014299), which shows a clinical C_D000928 activity, is chemically related to C_D007099 but does not inhibit the reuptake of C_D009638 and C_D012701, nor does it induce beta-adrenergic down-regulation. The mechanism of its C_D000928 activity is still unknown. The aim of the present study was to find out whether C_D014299 given repeatedly was able to induce adaptive changes in the C_D004298rgic and alpha1-adrenergic systems, demonstrated by us previously for various C_D000928s. C_D014299 was given to male Wistar rats and male Albino Swiss mice perorally twice daily for 14 days. In the acute experiment C_D014299 (given i.p.) does not antagonize the C_D012110 D_D007035 in mice and does not potentiate the C_D006916 head twitches in rats. C_D014299 given repeatedly to rats increases the locomotor D_D006948 induced by C_D003913, C_D019257 and (+)-7-hydroxy-dipropyloaminotetralin (C_D004298 D2 and D3 effects). The stereotypies induced by C_D003913 or C_D001058 are not potentiated by C_D014299. It increases the behaviour stimulation evoked by C_D010656 (given intraventricularly) in rats, evaluated in the open field test as well as the D_D010554 evoked by C_D003000 in mice, both these effects being mediated by an alpha1-adrenergic receptor. It may be concluded that, like other tricyclic C_D000928s studied previously, C_D014299 given repeatedly increases the responsiveness of brain C_D004298 D2 and D3 (locomotor activity but not stereotypy) as well as alpha1-adrenergic receptors to their agonists. A question arises whether the reuptake inhibition is of any importance to the adaptive changes induced by repeated C_D000928s, suggested to be responsible for the C_D000928 activity.

There are no similar reports with renal transplantation. We report a case of C_D011899-induced acute D_D009395 in a recipient of a cadaveric renal allograft presenting with acute allograft dysfunction within 48 hours of exposure to the drug. The biopsy specimen showed pathognomonic features, including eosinophilic infiltration of the interstitial compartment.

title:Is the treatment of D_D012532 hazardous?
abstract:Treatment for D_D012532 is usually initiated by general practitioners; most consider C_D001556 (C_D001556) the treatment of choice. C_D001556 is also widely used as an agricultural and industrial pesticide, and as a result the toxic profile of this insecticide is well understood. Evidence is accumulating that C_D001556 can be D_D002493 and may be associated with D_D000741. Preparations containing C_D001556 continue to be sold over the counter and may represent a hazard to poorly informed patients. This literature review suggests that general practitioners should prescribe scabicides with increased caution for certain at-risk groups, and give adequate warnings regarding potential D_D064420.

title:D_D064420 in rhesus monkeys following administration of the C_C080436 C_C068820 (C_C068820).
abstract:INTRODUCTION: Many substances that form methemoglobin (MHb) effectively counter cyanide (CN) D_D064420. Although MHb formers are generally applied as treatments for CN D_D011041, it has been proposed that a stable, long-acting MHb former could serve as a CN pretreatment. Using this rationale, the C_C080436 C_C068820, a potent long-lasting MHb former in rodents and beagle dogs, was studied in the rhesus monkey for advanced development as a potential CN pretreatment. METHODS: In this study, C_C068820 was administered intravenously (IV) in 2 female and 4 male rhesus monkeys in doses of 3.5 and/or 7.0 mg/kg; a single male also received C_C068820 orally (PO) at 7.0 mg/kg. Health status and MHb levels were monitored following exposure. RESULTS: The selected doses of C_C068820, which produced significant D_D008708 in beagle dogs in earlier studies conducted elsewhere, produced very little MHb (mean < 2.0%) in the rhesus monkey. Furthermore, transient D_D006456 was noted approximately 60 minutes postinjection of C_C068820 (3.5 or 7.0 mg/kg), and 2 lethalities occurred (one IV and one PO) following the 7.0 mg/kg dose. D_D009212 was also observed following the 7.0 mg/kg dose. Histopathology analyses in the 2 animals that died revealed liver and kidney D_D064420, with greater severity in the orally-treated animal. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate direct and/or indirect drug-induced D_D064420. It is concluded that C_C068820 should not be pursued as a pretreatment for CN D_D011041 unless the anti-CN characteristics of this compound can be successfully dissociated from those producing undesirable D_D064420.

title:Neuroplasticity of the adult primate auditory cortex following cochlear D_D034381.
abstract:Tonotopic organization is an essential feature of the primary auditory area (A1) of primate cortex. In A1 of macaque monkeys, low frequencies are represented rostrolaterally and high frequencies are represented caudomedially. The purpose of this study was to determine if changes occur in this tonotopic organization following cochlear D_D034381. Under anesthesia, the superior temporal gyrus of adult macaque monkeys was exposed, and the tonotopic organization of A1 was mapped using conventional microelectrode recording techniques. Following recovery, the monkeys were selectively deafened for high frequencies using C_D007612 and C_D005665. The actual frequencies deafened were determined by the loss of tone-burst elicited auditory brainstem responses. Three months after deafening, A1 was remapped. Postmortem cytoarchitectural features identifying A1 were correlated with the electrophysiologic data. The results indicate that the deprived area of A1 undergoes extensive reorganization and becomes responsive to intact cochlear frequencies. The region of cortex that represents the low frequencies was not obviously affected by the cochlear D_D034381.

title:D_D014202 side effects of C_D000420, quantified by a laser pointer technique.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: To study D_D014202 side effects of C_D000420 an easily applicable, quick and low-priced method is needed. A new method using a commercially available, pen-shaped laser pointer was developed. Aim of the study was to determine sensitivity, reproducibility, reference values and the agreement with a questionnaire. METHODS: D_D014202 was measured using a laser pointer technique. To determine sensitivity we assessed D_D014202 in 44 patients with D_D008173 after administration of cumulative doses of C_D000420. Subjects were asked to aim at the centre of a target, subdivided in concentric circles, from 5 m distance. The circle in which the participant succeeded to aim was recorded in millimetres radius. In another series of measurements, reproducibility and reference values of the D_D014202 was assessed in 65 healthy subjects in three sessions, at 9 a.m., 4 p.m. and 9 a.m., respectively, 1 week later. Postural D_D014202 was measured with the arm horizontally outstretched rest D_D014202 with the arm supported by an armrest and finally D_D014202 was measured after holding a 2-kg weight until exhaustion. Inter-observer variability was measured in a series of 10 healthy subjects. D_D014202 was measured simultaneously by two independent observers. RESULTS: C_D000420 significantly increased D_D014202 severity in patients in a dose-dependent way. Within healthy adults no age-dependency could be found (b = 0.262 mm/year; P = 0.72). There was no agreement between the questionnaire and D_D014202 severity (r = 0.093; P = 0.53). Postural D_D014202 showed no significant difference between the first and third session (P = 0.07). Support of the arm decreased D_D014202 severity, exhaustion increased D_D014202 severity significantly. A good agreement was found between two independent observers (interclass correlation coefficient 0.72). DISCUSSION: Quantifying D_D014202 by using an inexpensive laser pointer is, with the exception of children (<12 years) a sensitive and reproducible method.

title:Increased frequency of D_D054556 with the combination of C_C067311 and C_D013792 in patients with metastatic androgen-independent D_D011471.
abstract:STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of D_D054556 (D_D054556) in patients with advanced androgen-independent D_D011471 who were treated with C_C067311 alone or in combination with C_D013792. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of a randomized phase II trial. SETTING: National Institutes of Health clinical research center. PATIENTS: Seventy men, aged 50-80 years, with advanced androgen-independent D_D011471. INTERVENTION: Each patient received either intravenous C_C067311 30 mg/m2/week for 3 consecutive weeks, followed by 1 week off, or the combination of continuous oral C_D013792 200 mg every evening plus the same C_C067311 regimen. This 4-week cycle was repeated until there was evidence of excessive D_D064420 or disease progression. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: None of 23 patients who received C_C067311 alone developed D_D054556, whereas 9 of 47 patients (19%) who received C_C067311 plus C_D013792 developed D_D054556 (p=0.025). CONCLUSION: The addition of C_D013792 to C_C067311 in the treatment of D_D011471 significantly increases the frequency of D_D054556. Clinicians should be aware of this potential complication when adding C_D013792 to chemotherapeutic regimens.

The area under the plasma concentration time curve at 90 min was 4-12 times greater than for oral drug, suggesting the existence of an absorption-limiting process in the intestine, and providing an alternate form of administration for quaternary drugs.

title:Severe D_D013921 and D_D000743 associated with C_D002939: a case report with fatal outcome.
abstract:Haematological adverse reactions associated with fatal outcome are rare during treatment with C_D002939. A 30-year old Caucasian man reported with D_D015746 and D_D007565 after 3-day administration of oral C_D002939 for a suspect of D_D014552. Clinical evaluations suggested an initial diagnosis of severe D_D013921 and D_D006461. The patient progressively developed D_D011693 and D_D011693 on thorax and lower limbs. Despite pharmacological and supportive interventions, laboratory parameters worsened and the patient died 17 hours after admission. An accurate autopsy revealed most organs with diffuse petechial D_D006470. No signs of D_D001855 were found. No D_D013927 or signs of D_D014652 were observed in arterial vessels. Blood and urine cultures did not show any bacterial growth. This case report shows that C_D002939 may precipitate life-threatening D_D013921 and D_D000743, even in the early phases of treatment and without apparent previous exposures.

Urgent fasciotomies were performed and the patient made an uneventful recovery with the withdrawal of C_D019821.

abstract:We report the case of a patient with C_D019980-induced D_D056486 with histologic multiple D_D006099. This type of lesion broadens the spectrum of D_D056486 due to this drug combination, mainly represented by a benign D_D002779. The association of D_D006099 and D_D004802 favor an immunoallergic mechanism. As C_D010406 derivatives and C_D000658 alone are known to induce such types of lesions, the C_D000658 component, with or without a potentiating effect of C_D019818, might have a major role.

title:D_D002532 and D_D019970: analysis of prognostic indicators.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: The outcome of D_D013345 associated with D_D019970 is reportedly poor. However, no study in the literature has reported the use of a statistical model to analyze the variables that influence outcome. METHODS: A review of admissions during a 6-year period revealed 14 patients with C_D003042-related D_D000783. This group was compared with a control group of 135 patients with ruptured D_D000783 and no history of D_D019970. Age at presentation, time of ictus after intoxication, Hunt and Hess grade of D_D013345, size of the D_D000783, location of the D_D000783, and the Glasgow Outcome Scale score were assessed and compared. RESULTS: The patients in the study group were significantly younger than the patients in the control group (P < 0.002). In patients in the study group, all D_D000783 were located in the anterior circulation. The majority of these D_D000783 were smaller than those of the control group (8 +/- 6.08 mm versus 11 +/- 5.4 mm; P = 0.05). The differences in mortality and morbidity between the two groups were not significant. Hunt and Hess grade (P < 0.005) and age (P < 0.007) were significant predictors of outcome for the patients with C_D003042-related D_D000783. CONCLUSION: C_D003042 use predisposed D_D000783al rupture at a significantly earlier age and in much smaller D_D000783. Contrary to the published literature, this group did reasonably well with aggressive management.

title:Anti-D_D004827 drugs-induced de novo D_D004832.
abstract:The authors present three patients with de novo D_D004832 after administration of C_D002220 and C_D020888. Despite the underlying diseases, the prognosis for drug-induced de novo D_D004832 is good because it subsides rapidly after discontinuing the use of the offending drugs. The C_D005680-transmitted thalamocortical circuitry accounts for a major part of the underlying neurophysiology of the D_D004832. Because drug-induced de novo D_D004832 is rare, pro-absence drugs can only be considered a promoting factor. The underlying epileptogenecity of the patients or the synergistic effects of the accompanying drugs is required to trigger the de novo D_D004832. The possibility of drug-induced aggravation should be considered whenever an unexpected increase in D_D012640 frequency and/or new D_D012640 types appear following a change in drug treatment. By understanding the underlying mechanism of D_D004832, we can avoid the inappropriate use of anticonvulsants in children with D_D004827 and prevent drug-induced D_D004832.

title:C_D011342-induced polymorphous D_D017180.
abstract:Seven cases of C_D011342-induced polymorphous D_D017180 are presented. In four patients, polymorphous D_D017180 appeared after intravenous administration of 200 to 400 mg of C_D011342 for the treatment of sustained D_D017180. In the remaining three patients, C_D011342 was administered orally for treatment of chronic D_D018879 or D_D001282. These patients had D_D008133 and recurrent D_D013575 due to polymorphous D_D017180. In four patients, the D_D001145 was rapidly diagnosed and treated with disappearance of further episodes of the D_D001145. In two patients, the D_D001145 degenerated into irreversible D_D014693 and both patients died. In the seventh patient, a permanent ventricular pacemaker was inserted and, despite continuation of C_D011342 therapy, polymorphous D_D017180 did not reoccur. These seven cases demonstrate that C_D011342 can produce an acquired D_D008133 with polymorphous D_D017180.

title:Role of activation of C_D001920 B2 receptors in disruption of the blood-brain barrier during acute D_D006973.
abstract:Cellular mechanisms which account for disruption the blood-brain barrier during acute D_D006973 are not clear. The goal of this study was to determine the role of synthesis/release of C_D001920 to activate B2 receptors in disruption of the blood-brain barrier during acute D_D006973. Permeability of the blood-brain barrier was quantitated by clearance of fluorescent-labeled C_D003911 before and during C_D010656-induced acute D_D006973 in rats treated with vehicle and C_C065679 (0.1 microM). C_D010656 infusion increased arterial pressure, arteriolar diameter and clearance of fluorescent C_D003911 by a similar magnitude in both groups. These findings suggest that disruption of the blood-brain barrier during acute D_D006973 is not related to the synthesis/release of C_D001920 to activate B2 receptors.

title:C_D001374 potentiates D_D011230 in rat liver.
abstract:To test the validity of the hypothesis that hypomethylation of DNA plays an important role in the D_D011230, C_D001374 (C_D001374) (10 mg/kg), an inhibitor of DNA methylation, was given to rats during the phase of repair synthesis induced by the three carcinogens, C_D001564 (200 mg/kg), C_D008770 (60 mg/kg) and C_D019813 (C_D019813) (100 mg/kg). The initiated hepatocytes in the liver were assayed as the gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) positive foci formed following a 2-week selection regimen consisting of dietary 0.02% C_D015073 coupled with a necrogenic dose of C_D002251. The results obtained indicate that with all three carcinogens, administration of C_D001374 during repair synthesis increased the incidence of initiated hepatocytes, for example 10-20 foci/cm2 in C_D001374 and carcinogen-treated rats compared with 3-5 foci/cm2 in rats treated with carcinogen only. Administration of C_C014347 during the repair synthesis induced by C_D019813 further showed that 0.019 mol % of C_D003596 residues in DNA were substituted by the analogue, indicating that incorporation of C_D001374 occurs during repair synthesis. In the absence of the carcinogen, C_D001374 given after a two thirds partial hepatectomy, when its incorporation should be maximum, failed to induce any gamma-GT positive foci. The results suggest that hypomethylation of DNA per se may not be sufficient for initiation. Perhaps two events might be necessary for initiation, the first caused by the carcinogen and a second involving hypomethylation of DNA.

title:Withdrawal-emergent rabbit syndrome during dose reduction of C_D018967.
abstract:D_D001480 (D_D001480) is a rare extrapyramidal side effect caused by prolonged neuroleptic medication. Here we present a case of withdrawal-emergent D_D001480, which is the first of its kind to be reported. The patient developed D_D001480 during dose reduction of C_D018967. The symptom was treated successfully with C_D014282 anticholinergic therapy. The underlying mechanism of withdrawal-emergent D_D001480 in the present case may have been related to the pharmacological profile of C_D018967, a C_D012701-C_D004298 antagonist, suggesting the pathophysiologic influence of the C_D012701 system in the development of D_D001480.

abstract:C_D014700 is an effective and relatively-safe antiD_D006973 drug. Serious adverse effects are uncommon and mainly have been related to the D_D003866 of cardiac contractility and conduction, especially when the drug is combined with beta-blocking agents. We report a case in which D_D009203 coincided with the introduction of C_D002216 and the withdrawal of C_D014700 in a previously asymptomatic woman with severe D_D006973. Possible mechanisms that involve a C_D014700-related increase in platelet and/or vascular alpha 2-adrenoreceptor affinity for C_D002395 are discussed.

title:Remission induction of D_D008577 with high-dose intravenous C_D008727.
abstract:Twenty children with D_D054198 who developed D_D002493 were treated with a high-dose intravenous C_D008727 regimen that was designed to achieve and maintain CSF C_D008727 concentrations of 10(-5) mol/L without the need for concomitant intrathecal dosing. The C_D008727 was administered as a loading dose of 6,000 mg/m2 for a period of one hour followed by an infusion of 1,200 mg/m2/h for 23 hours. C_D002955 rescue was initiated 12 hours after the end of the infusion with a loading dose of 200 mg/m2 followed by 12 mg/m2 every three hours for six doses and then every six hours until the plasma C_D008727 level decreased to less than 1 X 10(-7) mol/L. The mean steady-state plasma and CSF C_D008727 concentrations achieved were 1.1 X 10(-3) mol/L and 3.6 X 10(-5) mol/L, respectively. All 20 patients responded to this regimen, 16/20 (80%) achieved a complete remission, and 20% obtained a partial remission. The most common D_D064420 encountered were transient serum transaminase and C_D001663 elevations, D_D009503, and D_D052016. One patient had focal D_D012640 and D_D010291 but recovered completely. High-dose intravenous C_D008727 is an effective treatment for the induction of remission after meningeal relapse in D_D054198.

title:The interpeduncular nucleus regulates C_D009538's effects on free-field activity.
abstract:Partial lesions were made with C_D007608 in the interpeduncular nucleus of the ventral midbrain of the rat. Compared with sham-operated controls, lesions significantly (p < 0.25) blunted the early (<60 min) free-field D_D009069 caused by C_D009538 (0.5 mg kg(-1), i.m.), enhanced the later (60-120 min) C_D009538-induced D_D006948, and raised spontaneous nocturnal activity. Lesions reduced the extent of immunohistological staining for C_D002794 acetyltransferase in the interpeduncular nucleus (p <0.025), but not for C_D014443 hydroxylase in the surrounding catecholaminergic A10 region. We conclude that the interpeduncular nucleus mediates nicotinic D_D003866 of locomotor activity and dampens nicotinic arousal mechanisms located elsewhere in the brain.

title:Assessment of a new non-invasive index of cardiac performance for detection of C_D004280-induced D_D017202.
abstract:BACKGROUND: Electrocardiography has a very low sensitivity in detecting C_D004280-induced D_D017202. OBJECTIVES: To assess the added diagnostic value of a new cardiac performance index (dP/dtejc) measurement, based on brachial artery flow changes, as compared to standard 12-lead ECG, for detecting C_D004280-induced D_D017202, using C_D017256 single-photon emission computed tomography as the gold standard of comparison to assess the presence or absence of D_D007511. METHODS: The study group comprised 40 patients undergoing C_D017256-SPECT/C_D004280 stress test. Simultaneous measurements of ECG and brachial artery dP/dtejc were performed at each C_D004280 level. In 19 of the 40 patients perfusion defects compatible with D_D007511 were detected on SPECT. The increase in dP/dtejc during infusion of C_D004280 in this group was severely impaired as compared to the non-ischemic group. dP/dtejc outcome was combined with the ECG results, giving an ECG-enhanced value, and compared to ECG alone. RESULTS: The sensitivity improved dramatically from 16% to 79%, positive predictive value increased from 60% to 68% and negative predictive value from 54% to 78%, and specificity decreased from 90% to 67%. CONCLUSIONS: If ECG alone is used for specificity, the combination with dP/dtejc improved the sensitivity of the test and could be a cost-savings alternative to cardiac imaging or perfusion studies to detect D_D017202, especially in patients unable to exercise.

title:D_D017114 in two patients with regular C_D000431 consumption ingesting C_D000082 at therapeutic dosage.
abstract:BACKGROUND: The possible role of C_D000431 in the development of D_D056486 associated with therapeutic doses of C_D000082 (C_D000082) is currently debated. CASE REPORT: We describe 2 patients who were regular consumers of C_D000431 and who developed D_D017093 within 3-5 days after hospitalization and stopping C_D000431 consumption while being treated with 4 g C_D000082/day. A C_D000082 serum level obtained in one of these patients was not in the toxic range. Possible risk factors for the development of D_D056486 in patients treated with therapeutic doses of C_D000082 are discussed. CONCLUSION: In patients with risk factors, e.g. regular consumption of C_D000431, D_D017093 is possible when therapeutic doses are ingested. We propose that the C_D000082 dose should not exceed 2 g/day in such patients and that their liver function should be monitored closely while being treated with C_D000082.

title:Severe D_D012206 and D_D058186 secondary to concomitant use of C_D019821, C_D000638, and C_C413408.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: To report a case of a severe interaction between C_D019821, C_D000638, and C_C413408 resulting in D_D012206 and D_D058186. BACKGROUND: A 72-year-old white man with underlying D_D015658, D_D001281, D_D003324, and D_D006949 presented with generalized D_D010146, D_D005221, and dark orange urine for 3 days. The patient was taking 80 mg C_D019821 at bedtime (initiated 27 days earlier); C_D000638 at a dose of 400 mg daily for 7 days, then 200 mg daily (initiated 19 days earlier); and 400 mg C_C413408 daily (initiated at least 2 years previously). Laboratory evaluation revealed 66,680 U/L C_D003401 kinase, 93 mg/dL C_D001806, 4.6 mg/dL C_D003404, 1579 U/L C_D001224 aminotransferase, and 738 U/L C_D000409 aminotransferase. C_D019821, C_D000638, and the patient's D_D015658 medications were all temporarily discontinued and the patient was given forced alkaline diuresis and started on dialysis. Nine days later the patient's C_D003401 kinase had dropped to 1695 U/L and C_D003404 was 3.3 mg/dL. The patient was discharged and continued outpatient dialysis for 1 month until his renal function recovered. DISCUSSION: The risk of D_D012206 is increased in the presence of concomitant drugs that inhibit C_D019821 metabolism. C_D019821 is metabolized by CYP3A4. C_D000638 and C_C413408 are recognized CYP3A4 inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacokinetic differences in C_D019821 are an important consideration for assessing the risk of potential drug interactions. In patients requiring the concurrent use of C_D019821 and CYP3A4 inhibitors, C_D017035, C_C065180, and C_C422923 carry the lowest risk of drug interactions; C_C065179 carries moderate risk, whereas C_D019821 and C_D008148 have the highest risk and should be avoided in patients taking concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors.

title:Phase II trial of C_C030852 in metastatic D_C562729. European Organization for Research and Treatment of D_D009369 Gastrointestinal Treat D_D009369 Cooperative Group.
abstract:PURPOSE: To evaluate the response rate and toxic effects of C_C030852 (C_C030852) administered as a single agent in metastatic D_C562729. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-six eligible patients with measurable lesions were included and were stratified according to previous chemotherapy. Thirty patients without prior chemotherapy and 16 pretreated with C_D002945-based chemotherapy were assessable for D_D064420 and response. C_C030852 was administered weekly as a 25-mg/m2 short intravenous (i.v.) infusion. RESULTS: Six of 30 patients (20%) without prior chemotherapy achieved a partial response (PR) (95% confidence interval [CI], 8% to 39%). The median duration of response was 21 weeks (range, 17 to 28). One of 16 patients (6%) with prior chemotherapy had a complete response (CR) of 31 weeks' duration (95% CI, 0% to 30%). The overall response rate (World Health Organization [WHO] criteria) was 15% (CR, 2%; PR 13%; 95% CI, 6% to 29%). The median dose-intensity (DI) was 20 mg/m2/wk. C_C030852 was well tolerated and zero instances of WHO grade 4 nonhematologic D_D064420 occurred. At least one episode of grade 3 or 4 D_D000380 was seen in 59% of patients. A grade 2 or 3 D_D007239 occurred in 16% of patients, but no toxic D_D003643 occurred. Other side effects were rare, and peripheral neuroD_D064420 has been minor (26% grade 1). CONCLUSION: These data indicate that C_C030852 is an active agent in metastatic D_C562729. Given its excellent tolerance profile and low D_D064420, further evaluation of C_C030852 in combination therapy is warranted.

The emergence of new active drugs might translate into more effective regimens for the treatment of this disease. METHODS: The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility, response rate, and D_D064420 of a C_D017239, C_D002945, and C_C056507 combination to treat metastatic D_D002289. Thirty-five consecutive chemotherapy-naive patients with Stage IV D_D002289 and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 were treated with a combination of C_D017239 (135 mg/m(2) given intravenously in 3 hours) on Day 1, C_D002945 (120 mg/m(2) given intravenously in 6 hours) on Day 1, and C_C056507 (800 mg/m(2) given intravenously in 30 minutes) on Days 1 and 8, every 4 weeks. Although responding patients were scheduled to receive consolidation radiotherapy and 24 patients received preplanned second-line chemotherapy after disease progression, the response and D_D064420 rates reported refer only to the chemotherapy regimen given. RESULTS: All the patients were examined for D_D064420; 34 were examinable for response. An objective response was observed in 73.5% of the patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 55.6-87.1%), including 4 complete responses (11.7%). According to intention-to-treat, the overall response rate was 71.4% (95% CI, 53. 7-85.4%). After 154 courses of therapy, the median dose intensity was 131 mg/m(2) for C_D017239 (97.3%), 117 mg/m(2) for C_D002945 (97.3%), and 1378 mg/m(2) for C_C056507 (86.2%). World Health Organization Grade 3-4 D_D009503 and D_D013921 occurred in 39.9% and 11.4% of patients, respectively. There was one treatment-related D_D003643. Nonhematologic D_D064420 were mild. After a median follow-up of 22 months, the median progression free survival rate was 7 months, and the median survival time was 16 months. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of C_D017239, C_D002945, and C_C056507 is well tolerated and shows high activity in metastatic D_D002289. This treatment merits further comparison with other C_D002945-based regimens.

title:Evaluation of adverse reactions of C_C016986 ophthalmic solution.
abstract:We prospectively evaluated the adverse reactions of C_C016986 in 20 normal volunteers by instilling a single drop of 1% C_C016986 in their right eyes. Examinations, including blood pressure, pulse rate, conjunctiva and cornea, intraocular pressure (IOP), pupil diameter, basal tear secretion and margin reflex distance of both upper and lower eyelids, were performed prior to entry and at 1, 3, 5 and 7 hours after instillation. The D_D015814 effects were statistically significant for C_C016986-treated eyes throughout the study and also statistically significant for contralateral eyes from three hours after topical administration of 1% C_C016986. D_D007022 were statistically, but not clinically, significant. No significant changes in diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate and basal tear secretion were noted. D_D003229 and D_D015878 were commonly found. Upper lid retraction was frequently noted. While the elevations of the upper lid margin in most subjects were not more than 2 mm and did not cause noticeable change in appearance, one subject suffered from mechanical D_D004774 and marked D_D003316 3 hours after instillation of the medication. This may well be a particularly notable finding in Asian people.

title:C_C017367-induced D_D019965.
abstract:D_D019965 was observed in a 29-year-old female in the prognostic period after the onset of C_C017367-induced D_D056784. Symptoms such as euphoria, emotional lability and puerile attitude noted in the patient were diagnosed as D_D010554 according to the criteria defined in the DSM-III-R. It is referred to as a D_D001927. Brain CT revealed a periventricular low density area in the frontal white matter and moderate dilatation of the lateral ventricles especially at the bilateral anterior horns. Consequently, C_C017367-induced D_D056784 may uncommonly result in D_D010554 in the residual state. It may be attributed to the D_D001927.

title:International C_D008801 and placebo antiarrhythmic coronary trial: I. Report on D_D001145 and other findings. Impact Research Group.
abstract:The antiarrhythmic effects of the sustained release form of C_D008801 (C_D008801) were evaluated in a double-blind placebo trial in 630 patients with recent documented D_D009203. The primary response variable was based on central reading of 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings and was defined as the occurrence of 30 or more single premature ventricular complexes in any two consecutive 30 minute blocks or one or more runs of two or more premature ventricular complexes in the entire 24 hour electrocardiographic recording. Large differences, regarded as statistically significant, between the C_D008801 and placebo groups were noted in that end point at months 1 and 4, but only trends were observed at month 12. These differences were observed even though the serum C_D008801 levels obtained in this study were generally lower than those observed in studies that have used the regular form of the drug. There were more D_D003643 in the C_D008801 group (7.6%) than in the placebo group (4.8%); the difference was not statistically significant. The incidence of coronary events was similar in both groups. Previously recognized side effects, particularly D_D014202 and D_D012817, were more frequent in the C_D008801 group than in the placebo group.

title:Regional localization of the antagonism of C_D000661-induced D_D006948 by intracerebral C_D002116 injections.
abstract:C_D002116 receptors are found in the brain, and intracerebral infusions of C_D002116 can produce behavioral effects. Among these behavioral effects are decreases in food intake and decreases in C_D000661-induced locomotor activity. In previous experiments we found that decreases in food intake were induced by local administration of C_D002116 into several hypothalamic sites and into the nucleus accumbens. In the present experiment C_D002116 decreased locomotor activity when locally injected into the same sites where it decreases food intake. The areas where C_D002116 is most effective in decreasing locomotor activity are located in the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens, suggesting that these areas are the major sites of action of C_D002116 in inhibiting C_D000661-induced locomotor activity.

title:Fatal D_D013345 associated with prehospital use of C_D004837.
abstract:We present a case of paramedic misjudgment in the execution of a protocol for the treatment of D_D004342 in a case of D_D011654 with D_D012135. The sudden onset of D_D012128, D_D005076, and a history of a new medicine led the two paramedics on the scene to administer subcutaneous C_D004837. Subsequently, acute D_D006323 and fatal D_D013345 occurred. C_D004837 has a proven role in D_D006323 in prehospital care; however, use by paramedics in patients with suspected D_D004342 and severe D_D006973 should be viewed with caution.

title:D_D018376 in rat fetuses exposed to C_D002118 channel blockers.
abstract:Preclinical toxicologic investigation suggested that a new C_D002118 channel blocker, C_D020748, induced D_D018376 in rat fetuses exposed to this agent during organogenesis. The present study was designed to investigate the hypothesis that C_D002118 channel blockers in general induce D_D018376 indicating a pharmacologic class effect. We studied three C_D002118 channel blockers of different structure, C_D009543, C_D004110, and C_D014700, along with the new agent. Pregnant rats were administered one of these C_D002118 channel blockers during the period of cardiac morphogenesis and the offspring examined on day 20 of gestation for D_D018376. A low incidence of D_D018376 was observed after exposure to each of the four C_D002118 channel blockers, but this incidence was statistically significant only for C_D014700 and C_D009543. All four agents were associated with aortic arch branching variants, although significantly increased only for C_D020748 and C_D014700.

title:Differential impact of immune escape mutations G145R and P120T on the replication of C_D019259-resistant C_D006513-positive and -negative strains.
abstract:Immune escape variants of the D_D006509 virus (HBV) represent an emerging clinical challenge, because they can be associated with vaccine escape, HBV reactivation, and failure of diagnostic tests. Recent data suggest a preferential selection of immune escape mutants in distinct peripheral blood leukocyte compartments of infected individuals. We therefore systematically analyzed the functional impact of the most prevalent immune escape variants, the sG145R and sP120T mutants, on the viral replication efficacy and antiviral drug susceptibility of common treatment-associated mutants with resistance to C_D019259 (C_D019259) and/or C_D006513 negativity. Replication-competent HBV strains with sG145R or sP120T and C_D019259 resistance (rtM204I or rtL180M/rtM204V) were generated on an C_D006513-positive and an C_D006513-negative background with precore (PC) and basal core promoter (BCP) mutants. The sG145R mutation strongly reduced C_D006514 levels and was able to fully restore the impaired replication of C_D019259-resistant HBV mutants to the levels of wild-type HBV, and PC or BCP mutations further enhanced viral replication. Although the sP120T substitution also impaired C_D006514 secretion, it did not enhance the replication of C_D019259-resistant clones. However, the concomitant occurrence of C_D006513 negativity (PC/BCP), sP120T, and C_D019259 resistance resulted in the restoration of replication to levels of wild-type HBV. In all clones with combined immune escape and C_D019259 resistance mutations, the C_D009711 analogues C_C053001 and C_C096918 remained effective in suppressing viral replication in vitro. These findings reveal the differential impact of immune escape variants on the replication and drug susceptibility of complex HBV mutants, supporting the need of close surveillance and treatment adjustment in response to the selection of distinct mutational patterns.

title:The effects of C_C009250 on C_D008012-induced D_D012640.
abstract:The influence of C_C009250 on C_D008012-induced D_D012640 was studied in cats. The D_D012640 threshold (mean +/- SD) was 41.4 +/- 6.5 mg. l(-1) with C_D008012 infusion (6 mg.kg(-1).min(-1)), increasing significantly to 66.6 +/- 10.9 mg. l(-1) when the end-tidal concentration of C_C009250 was 0.8%. However, the threshold (61.6 +/- 8.7 mg. l(-1)) during 1.6% C_C009250 was not significant from that during 0.8% C_C009250, indicating a celling effect. There was no significant difference in the D_D012640 threshold between C_C009250 and C_D004737. The rise in blood pressure became less marked when higher concentrations of C_C009250 or C_D004737 were administered and the blood pressure at D_D012640 decreased significantly in 1.6% C_C009250, and in 0.8% and 1.6% C_D004737. However, there was no significant difference in the C_D008012 concentrations measured when the systolic blood pressure became 70 mmHg. C_D001030, a selective blocker of C_D002118-dependent C_D011188 channels, was administered intracerebroventricularly in rats anesthetized with 0.8% C_C009250 to investigate the mechanism of the antiD_D012640 effects. C_D001030 (10 ng) had a tendency to decrease the D_D012640 threshold (21.6 +/- 2.2 to 19.9 +/- 2.5 mg. l(-1)) but this was not statistically significant. It is suggested that C_C009250 reduces the D_D012640 effect of C_D008012 D_D064420 but carries some risk due to circulatory D_D003866.

title:Anti-oxidant effects of C_C065179 in C_D003907-induced D_D006973 in the rat.
abstract:1. C_D003907 (C_D003907)-induced D_D006973 is characterized by endothelial dysfunction associated with C_D009569 (C_D009569) deficiency and increased C_D013481 (C_D013481) production. C_C065179 (C_C065179) possesses pleiotropic properties that have been reported to improve endothelial function through increased availability of C_D009569 and reduced C_D013481 production in various forms of D_D006973. In the present study, we investigated whether 50 mg/kg per day, p.o., C_C065179 could prevent endothelial C_D009569 synthase (eC_D009569S) downregulation and the increase in C_D013481 in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, thereby reducing blood pressure. 2. Male SD rats (n = 30) were treated with C_C065179 (50 mg/kg per day in drinking water) or tap water for 15 days. C_D003907 (10 microg/kg per day, s.c.) or saline was started after 4 days in C_C065179-treated and non-treated rats and continued for 11-13 days. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured on alternate days using the tail-cuff method. Endothelial function was assessed by C_D000109-induced vasorelaxation and C_D010656-induced vasoconstriction in aortic segments. Vascular eC_D009569S mRNA was assessed by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. 3. In rats treated with C_D003907 alone, SBP was increased from 109 +/- 2 to 133 +/- 2 mmHg on Days 4 and Day 14, respectively (P < 0.001). In the C_C065179 + C_D003907 group, SBP was increased from 113 +/- 2 to 119 +/- 2 mmHg on Days 4 to 14, respectively (P < 0.001), but was significantly lower than SBP in the group treated with C_D003907 alone (P < 0.05). Endothelial-dependent relaxation and eC_D009569S mRNA expression were greater in the C_D003907 + C_C065179 group than in the C_D003907 only group (P < 0.05 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Aortic C_D013481 production was lower in the C_D003907 + C_C065179 group compared with the group treated with C_D003907 alone (P < 0.0001). 4. Treatment with C_C065179 improved endothelial function, reduced C_D013481 production and reduced SBP in C_D003907-treated SD rats.

title:C_C067171 for detection of C_D007545-induced D_D009203 in rats.
abstract:D_D007238-avid radiopharmaceuticals are necessary for rapid and timely diagnosis of acute D_D009203. The animal model used to produce D_D007238 implies artery ligation but chemical induction can be easily obtained with C_D007545. A new D_D007238-avid radiopharmaceutical based on C_D005937 was prepared in the hospital radiopharmacy of the INCMNSZ. C_C067171 was easy to prepare, stable for 96 h and was used to study its biodistribution in rats with C_D007545-induced acute D_D009203. Histological studies demonstrated that the rats developed an D_D007238 18 h after C_D007545 administration. The rat biodistribution studies showed a rapid blood clearance via the kidneys. Thirty minutes after C_C067171 administration the standardised heart uptake value S(h)UV was 4.7 in D_D007238ed rat heart which is six times more than in normal rats. ROIs drawn over the gamma camera images showed a ratio of 4.4. The high image quality suggests that high contrast images can be obtained in humans and the 96 h stability makes it an ideal agent to detect, in patients, early cardiac D_D007238.

title:A randomized, placebo-controlled dose-comparison trial of C_D006220 for D_D011618 and D_D019958 in D_D000544.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy and side effects of two doses of C_D006220 and placebo in the treatment of D_D011618 and D_D019958 in patients with D_D000544. METHOD: In a 6-week random-assignment, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (phase A), C_D006220, 2-3 mg/day (standard dose), and C_D006220, 0.50-0.75 mg/day (low dose), were compared in 71 outpatients with D_D000544. For the subsequent 6-week double-blind crossover phase (phase B), patients taking standard- or low-dose C_D006220 were switched to placebo, and patients taking placebo were randomly assigned to standard- or low-dose C_D006220. RESULTS: For the 60 patients who completed phase A, standard-dose C_D006220 was efficacious and superior to both low-dose C_D006220 and placebo for scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale D_D011618 factor and on D_D011595. Response rates according to three sets of criteria were greater with the standard dose (55%-60%) than the low dose (25%-35%) and placebo (25%-30%). The advantage of standard dose over low dose was replicated in phase B. In phase A, D_D001480 tended to be greater with the standard dose than in the other two conditions, primarily because of a subgroup (20%) who developed moderate to severe signs. Low-dose C_D006220 did not differ from placebo on any measure of efficacy or side effects. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated a favorable therapeutic profile for C_D006220 in doses of 2-3 mg/day, although a subgroup developed moderate to severe D_D001480. A starting dose of 1 mg/day with gradual, upward dose titration is recommended. The narrow therapeutic window observed with C_D006220 may also apply to other neuroleptics used in D_D000544 patients with D_D011618 and D_D019958.

title:Individual differences in renal ACE activity in healthy rats predict susceptibility to C_D004317-induced D_D007674.
abstract:BACKGROUND: In man, differences in C_D000809-converting enzyme (ACE) levels, related to ACE (I/D) genotype, are associated with renal prognosis. This raises the hypothesis that individual differences in renal ACE activity are involved in renal susceptibility to inflicted damage. Therefore, we studied the predictive effect of renal ACE activity for the severity of D_D007674 induced by a single injection of C_D004317 in rats. METHODS: Renal ACE activity (C_C010980 cleavage by cortical homogenates) was determined by renal biopsy in 27 adult male Wistar rats. After 1 week of recovery, D_D011507 was induced by C_D004317 [1.5 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.) n = 18; controls, saline i.v. n = 9]. D_D011507 was measured every 2 weeks. After 12 weeks, rats were sacrificed and their kidneys harvested. RESULTS: As anticipated, C_D004317 elicited D_D009404 range D_D011507, D_D007674 and mild D_D005923. Baseline renal ACE positively correlated with the relative rise in D_D011507 after C_D004317 (r = 0.62, P<0.01), renal interstitial alpha-smooth muscle actin (r = 0.49, P<0.05), interstitial macrophage influx (r = 0.56, P<0.05), interstitial collagen III (r = 0.53, P<0.05), glomerular alpha-smooth muscle actin (r = 0.74, P<0.01) and glomerular desmin (r = 0.48, P<0.05). Baseline renal ACE did not correlate with D_D005923 (r = 0.22, NS). In controls, no predictive values for renal parameters were observed. CONCLUSION: Individual differences in renal ACE activity predict the severity of C_D004317-induced D_D007674 in this outbred rat strain. This supports the assumption that differences in renal ACE activity predispose to a less favourable course of D_D007674.

title:Clinical D_D007674 of C_D014031 and C_D005839. A prospective study.
abstract:Nearly 3.2 million people in this country receive C_D000617 antibiotics annually. C_D005839 and C_D014031 sulfate continue to demonstrate D_D006311 and D_D007674 in both animal and clinical studies. In this study, 62 patients with confirmed initial normal renal function and treated with 2 to 5 mg/kg/day of C_D005839 sulfate or C_D014031 sulfate for a minimum of seven days were followed up prospectively for the development of C_D000617-related D_D051437, defined as at least a one-third reduction in renal function. In these 62 patients, no other causes for D_D051437 could be identified. Five of 33 (15%) of the C_D014031-treated patients and 16 of 29 (55.2%) of the C_D005839-treated patients had D_D051437. Thus, C_D005839 was associated with D_D051437 more than three times as often as was C_D014031.

title:Neuroprotective action of C_C121465, a selective mGluR5 antagonist, in C_D008694-induced C_D004298rgic D_D020258 is associated with a decrease in C_D004298 outflow and inhibition of D_D005334 in rats.
abstract:The aim of this study was to examine the role of metabotropic C_D018698 receptor 5 (mGluR5) in the toxic action of C_D008694 on C_D004298rgic neurones in rats. C_D008694 (10 mg/kg sc), administered five times, reduced the levels of C_D004298 and its metabolites in striatal tissue when measured 72 h after the last injection. A selective antagonist of mGluR5, C_C121465 (C_C121465; 5 mg/kg ip), when administered five times immediately before each C_D008694 injection reversed the above-mentioned C_D008694 effects. A single C_C121465 (5 mg/kg ip) injection reduced the basal extracellular C_D004298 level in the striatum, as well as C_D004298 release stimulated either by C_D008694 (10 mg/kg sc) or by intrastriatally administered C_D014701 (100 microM). Moreover, it transiently diminished the C_D008694 (10 mg/kg sc)-induced D_D005334 and reduced basal body temperature. C_C121465 administered into the striatum at high concentrations (500 microM) increased extracellular C_D004298 levels, while lower concentrations (50-100 microM) were devoid of any effect. The results of this study suggest that the blockade of mGluR5 by C_C121465 may protect C_D004298rgic neurones against C_D008694-induced D_D064420. Neuroprotection rendered by C_C121465 may be associated with the reduction of the C_D008694-induced C_D004298 efflux in the striatum due to the blockade of extrastriatal mGluR5, and with a decrease in D_D005334.

title:Pharmacokinetics of C_D003891 when administered with C_C476217.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: In vitro work has demonstrated that C_C476217 is a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme (CYP) 2D6. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of C_C476217 on CYP2D6 activity, using C_D003891 as a probe substrate, in healthy subjects. METHODS: Seventeen subjects who were genotyped as CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers were enrolled in this randomized, open-label, crossover study to receive a single oral dose of C_D003891 (50 mg) on two separate occasions, once alone and once after multiple doses of C_C476217 (90 mg for 7 days). Blood samples were obtained predose and up to 72 h postdose. RESULTS: Fourteen subjects completed both treatment arms. Relative to C_D003891 alone, mean AUC and C(max) of C_D003891 increased 3.6- and 1.8-fold when coadministered with C_C476217. The t (1/2,z) of C_D003891 was longer when C_D003891 was coadministered with C_C476217 (21.0 versus 43.3 hs). The t (max) was similar between the regimens. Fewer subjects reported adverse events following treatment with C_D003891 alone than when receiving C_D003891 with C_C476217 (33 versus 86%), the most frequent of which (D_D009325 and D_D006261) have been reported for patients treated with either C_D003891 or C_C476217. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that C_C476217 is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6. These data suggest that during concomitant treatment with C_C476217, dose adjustment may be necessary for drugs that demonstrate a narrow therapeutic index and are metabolized by CYP2D6.

title:Proteomic analysis of striatal proteins in the rat model of C_D007980-induced D_D004409.
abstract:C_D007980-induced D_D004409 (D_D004409) is among the motor complications that arise in D_D010300 (D_D010300) patients after a prolonged treatment with C_D007980. To this day, transcriptome analysis has been performed in a rat model of D_D004409 [Neurobiol. Dis., 17 (2004), 219] but information regarding the proteome is still lacking. In the present study, we investigated the changes occurring at the protein level in striatal samples obtained from the unilaterally C_D016627-lesion rat model of D_D010300 treated with saline, C_D007980 or C_D001971 using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (MS). Rats treated with C_D007980 were allocated to two groups based on the presence or absence of D_D004409. Among the 2000 spots compared for statistical difference, 67 spots were significantly changed in abundance and identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight MS, atmospheric pressure matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization and HPLC coupled tandem MS (LC/MS/MS). Out of these 67 proteins, D_D004409 significantly changed the expression level of five proteins: alphabeta-crystalin, gamma-enolase, guanidoacetate methyltransferase, vinculin, and proteasome alpha-2 subunit. Complementary techniques such as western immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry were performed to investigate the validity of the data obtained using the proteomic approach. In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the protein changes occurring in D_D004409.

title:Pseudo-D_D004342 to C_D000305: diagnosis and alternatives.
abstract:Two patients treated with parenteral C_D010248 (Triniol) and C_D003907 (Sedionbel) are described. A few minutes after administration of the drugs, they presented D_D014581 (patients 1 and 2) and D_D003231 (patient 1). The purpose of our study was to determine the cause of the patients' reactions, the immunological mechanisms involved and whether these patients would be able to tolerate any kind of corticoid. Clinical examinations and skin, oral and parenteral challenges with different C_D000305 and ELISA tests were performed. In the two patients, skin and ELISA tests with C_D010248 were negative, as was the prick test with each of its excipients. A single-blind parenteral challenge with Triniol was positive in both patients after the administration of 1 ml of the drug, and negative with its excipients. We also carried out oral and parenteral challenges with other C_D000305 and found intolerance to some of them. These results suggest that C_D010248 caused pseudoD_D004342 in our patients. Corticosteroids different from C_D010248 also produced D_D004342 reactions in these patients; however, a few of them were tolerated. The basic mechanisms of those reactions are not yet fully understood. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a pseudo-D_D004342 caused by C_D010248.

title:C_D014635 induced D_D001927--19 new cases in Germany from 1994 to 2003--a side effect associated to C_D014635-therapy not only in young children.
abstract:C_D014635 (C_D014635) is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug and is usually well-tolerated. Rare serious complications may occur in some patients, including haemorrhagic D_D010195, D_D001855, C_D014635-induced D_D056486 and C_D014635-induced D_D001927. The typical signs of C_D014635-induced D_D001927 are D_D003244, sometimes marked EEG background slowing, increased D_D012640 frequency, with or without D_D022124. There is still no proof of causative effect of C_D014635 in patients with D_D001927, but only of an association with an assumed causal relation. We report 19 patients with C_D014635-associated D_D001927 in Germany from the years 1994 to 2003, none of whom had been published previously.

title:D_D006463 after treatment with C_D008795.
abstract:This paper describes the clinical features of six children who developed the D_D006463 after treatment with C_D008795. These children were older and were more likely to have undergone recent bowel surgery than are other children with this condition. While the involvement of C_D008795 in the aetiology of the D_D006463 is not established firmly, the action of this drug in sensitizing tissues to oxidation injury and the reported evidence of oxidation changes in the D_D006463 suggest a possible link between C_D008795 treatment and some cases of the D_D006463.

title:Risk factors of D_D006319 in preterm infants.
abstract:Among 547 preterm infants of < or = 34 weeks gestation born between 1987 and 1991, 8 children (1.46%) developed severe progressive and bilateral D_D006319. Perinatal risk factors of infants with D_D034381 were compared with those of two control groups matched for gestation and birth weight and for perinatal complications. Our observations demonstrated an association of D_D034381 with a higher incidence of perinatal complications. D_D006311 appeared closely related to a prolonged administration and higher total dose of D_D006311 drugs, particularly C_D000617 and C_D005665. Finally, we strongly recommend to prospectively and regularly perform audiologic assessment in sick preterm children as D_D034381 is of delayed onset and in most cases bilateral and severe.

title:Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies in patients with C_D002927-associated mental D_D003221.
abstract:15 cases of C_D002927-associated mental D_D003221 have been reported. In order that this syndrome might be investigated changes in mental status (M.S.) were correlated with serum concentrations and renal and hepatic function in 36 patients, 30 patients had no M.S. change on C_D002927 and 6 had moderate to severe changes. These 6 patients had both renal and liver dysfunction (P less than 0.05), as well as C_D002927 trough-concentrations of more than 1.25 microgram/ml (P less than 0.05). The severity of M.S. changes increased as trough-concentrations rose, 5 patients had lumbar puncture. The cerebrospinal fluid: serum ratio of C_D002927 concentrations was 0.24:1 and indicates that C_D002927 passes the blood-brain barrier; it also raises the possibility that M.S. changes are due to blockade of C_D006632 H2-receptors in the central nervous system. Patients likely to have both raised trough-concentrations and mental D_D003221 are those with both severe renal and hepatic dysfunction. They should be closely observed and should be given reduced doses of C_D002927.

title:Different lobular distributions of altered hepatocyte tight junctions in rat models of intrahepatic and extrahepatic D_D002779.
abstract:Hepatocyte tight junctions (TJs), the only intercellular barrier between the sinusoidal and the canalicular spaces, play a key role in bile formation. Although hepatocyte TJs are impaired in D_D002779, attempts to localize the precise site of hepatocyte TJ damage by freeze-fracture electron microscopy have produced limited information. Recently, several TJ-associated proteins like ZO-1 and 7H6 have been identified and characterized. Immunolocalization of 7H6 appears to closely correlate with paracellular permeability. We used rat models of intrahepatic D_D002779 by C_D004997 (C_D004997) treatment and extrahepatic D_D002779 by bile duct ligation (BDL) to precisely determine the site of TJ damage. Alterations in hepatocyte TJs were assessed by double-immunolabeling for 7H6 and ZO-1 using a confocal laser scanning microscope. In control rats, immunostaining for 7H6 and ZO-1 colocalized to outline bile canaliculi in a continuous fashion. In contrast, 7H6 and ZO-1 immunostaining was more discontinuous, outlining the bile canaliculi after BDL. Immunostaining for 7H6, not ZO-1, decreased and predominantly appeared as discrete signals in the submembranous cytoplasm of periportal hepatocytes after BDL. After C_D004997 treatment, changes in immunostaining for 7H6 and ZO-1 were similar to those seen in periportal hepatocytes after BDL, but distributed more diffusely throughout the lobule. This study is the first to demonstrate that impairment of hepatocyte TJs occurs heterogenously in the liver lobule after BDL and suggests that BDL and C_D004997 treatments produce different lobular distributions of increased paracellular permeability.

title:Long term audiological evaluation of D_D017086 patients.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify the incidence and to monitor the progression of D_D034381 in children and young adults with D_D017086 major. METHODS: One hundred and four (104) patients aged 6-35 years (mean 17,2 years) participated in the study. All patients were on a regular transfusion-chelation program maintaining a mean hemoglobin level of 9.5 gr/dl. Subjects were receiving C_D003676 (C_D003676) chelation treatment with a mean daily dose of 50-60 mg/kg, 5-6 days a week during the first six years of the study, which was then reduced to 40-50 mg/kg for the following eight years. Patients were followed for 8-14 years. RESULTS: Overall, 21 out of 104 patients (20.2%) presented with high frequency sensorineural D_D034381 (D_D006319), either unilateral or bilateral. No D_D006311 factor, other than C_D003676, was present in any of the patients. Patients with D_D006319 presented with relatively lower serum ferritin levels than those with normal hearing, however, no statistically significant difference was observed. Subjects with D_D006319 were submitted to C_D003676 reduction or temporary withdrawal. Following intervention, 7 out of 21 affected patients recovered, 10 remained stable and 4 demonstrated aggravation. CONCLUSION: The findings are indicative of C_D003676's contributing role in the development of D_D034381. Regular audiologic evaluation is imperative in all D_D013789 patients so that early changes may be recognized and treatment may be judiciously adjusted in order to prevent or reverse D_D034381.

title:Design and analysis of the HYPREN-trial: safety of C_D004656 and C_D011224 in the initial treatment phase of patients with D_D006333.
abstract:Since the introduction of C_D000806 into the adjunctive treatment of patients with D_D006333, cases of severe D_D007022, especially on the first day of treatment, have occasionally been reported. To assess the safety of the C_D000806 C_D004656 a multicenter, randomized, C_D011224-controlled trial was designed that compared the incidence and severity of symptomatic D_D007022 on the first day of treatment. Trial medication was 2.5 mg C_D004656 or 0.5 C_D011224. Subjects were 1210 inpatients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II and III. Patients who received C_D004656 experienced clinically and statistically significantly less symptomatic D_D007022 (5.2%) than the patients who received C_D011224 (12.9%). All patients recovered. It was concluded that treatment with C_D004656 was well tolerated and it is, therefore, unreasonable to restrict the initiation of treatment with C_D004656 to inpatients.

title:Antagonism between interleukin 3 and erythropoietin in mice with C_D015215-induced D_D000740 and in bone marrow endothelial cells.
abstract:C_D015215 (C_D015215)-induced D_D000740 in mice can be reversed by the administration of IGF-IL-3 (fusion protein of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF II) and interleukin 3). Although interleukin 3 (IL-3) and erythropoietin (EPO) are known to act synergistically on hematopoietic cell proliferation in vitro, injection of IGF-IL-3 and EPO in C_D015215-treated mice resulted in a reduction of red cells and an increase of plasma EPO levels as compared to animals treated with IGF-IL-3 or EPO alone. We tested the hypothesis that the antagonistic effect of IL-3 and EPO on erythroid cells may be mediated by endothelial cells. Bovine liver erythroid cells were cultured on monolayers of human bone marrow endothelial cells previously treated with EPO and IGF-IL-3. There was a significant reduction of C_D013936 incorporation into both erythroid and endothelial cells in cultures pre-treated with IGF-IL-3 and EPO. Endothelial cell culture supernatants separated by ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation from cells treated with EPO and IL-3 significantly reduced C_D013936 incorporation into erythroid cells as compared to identical fractions obtained from the media of cells cultured with EPO alone. These results suggest that endothelial cells treated simultaneously with EPO and IL-3 have a negative effect on erythroid cell production.

title:Interactive effects of variations in [C_D012964]o and [C_D002118]o on rat atrial spontaneous frequency.
abstract:The effects of varying the extracellular concentrations of C_D012964 and C_D002118 ([C_D012964]o and [C_D002118]o) on both, the spontaneous beating and the negative chronotropic action of C_D014700, were studied in the isolated rat atria. Basal frequency (BF) evaluated by surface electrogram was 223 +/- 4 beats/min. in control Krebs-Ringer containing 137 mM C_D012964 and 1.35 mM C_D002118 (N). It decreased by 16 +/- 3% by lowering [C_D012964]o to 78 mM (LC_D012964), 23 +/- 2% by lowering simultaneously [C_D012964]o to 78 mM and [C_D002118]o to 0.675 mM (LC_D012964+LC_D002118) and 31 +/- 5% by lowering [C_D012964]o to 78 mM plus increasing [C_D002118]o to 3.6 mM (LC_D012964+HC_D002118). At normal [C_D012964]o, decrease (0.675 mM) or increase (3.6 mM) of [C_D002118]o did not modify BF; a reduction of ten times (0.135 mM of normal [C_D002118]o was effective to reduce BF by 40 +/- 13%. All negative chronotropic effects were BF-dependent. Dose-dependent D_D001919 induced by C_D014700 was potentiated by LC_D012964, LC_D002118, and HC_D002118. Independent but not additive effects of C_D012964 and C_D002118 are shown by decreases in the values of [C_D014700]o needed to reduce BF by 30% (IC30) with the following order of inhibitory potency: LC_D012964 > LC_D002118 > HC_D002118 > N, resulting LC_D012964+HC_D002118 similar to LC_D012964. The [C_D014700]o that arrested atrial beating (AC) was also potentiated with the order LC_D012964 = LC_D012964+LC_D002118 = LC_D012964+HC_D002118 = LC_D002118 > HC_D002118 = N. The results indicate that rat atrial spontaneous beating is more dependent on [C_D012964]o than on [C_D002118]o in a range of +/- 50% of their normal concentration. Also the enhancement of C_D014700 effects on atrial beating was more pronounced at LC_D012964 than at LC_D002118.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

title:C_D012964 status influences chronic C_D000666 D_D007674 in rats.
abstract:The D_D007674 potential of C_D000666 (5 mg/kg per day intraperitoneally for 3 weeks) has been investigated in salt-depleted, normal-salt, and salt-loaded rats. In salt-depleted rats, C_D000666 decreased C_D003404 clearance linearly with time, with an 85% reduction by week 3. In contrast, in normal-salt rats C_D003404 clearance was decreased but to a lesser extent at week 2 and 3, and in salt-loaded rats C_D003404 clearance did not change for 2 weeks and was decreased by 43% at week 3. All rats in the C_D012964-depleted group had histopathological evidence of patchy tubular cytoplasmic degeneration in tubules that was not observed in any normal-salt or salt-loaded rat. Concentrations of C_D000666 in plasma were not significantly different among the three groups at any time during the study. However, at the end of 3 weeks, C_D000666 levels in the kidneys and liver were significantly higher in salt-depleted and normal-salt rats than those in salt-loaded rats, with plasma/kidney ratios of 21, 14, and 8 in salt-depleted, normal-salt, and salt-loaded rats, respectively. In conclusion, reductions in C_D003404 clearance and renal C_D000666 accumulation after chronic C_D000666 administration were enhanced by salt depletion and attenuated by C_D012964 loading in rats.

title:Reversible D_D001927 in C_D008795-induced D_D001927: magnetic resonance findings on diffusion-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: This is to present reversible D_D001927s in C_D008795-induced D_D001927, to focus on the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From November 2005 to September 2007, 8 patients (5 men and 3 women) were diagnosed as having C_D008795-induced D_D001927 (age range; 43-78 years). They had been taking C_D008795 (total dosage, 45-120 g; duration, 30 days to 2 months) to treat the D_D007239 in various organs. Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were obtained after the hospitalization, including DWI (8/8), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map (4/8), FLAIR (7/8), and T2-weighted image (8/8). Follow-up MRIs were performed on 5 patients from third to 14th days after discontinuation of C_D008795 administration. Findings of initial and follow-up MRIs were retrospectively evaluated by 2 neuroradiologists by consensus, to analyze the presence of abnormal signal intensities, their locations, and signal changes on follow-up images. RESULTS: Initial MRIs showed abnormal high signal intensities on DWI and FLAIR (or T2-weighted image) at the dentate nucleus (8/8), inferior colliculus (6/8), corpus callosum (2/8), pons (2/8), medulla (1/8), and bilateral cerebral white matter (1/8). High-signal intensity lesions on DWI tended to show low signal intensity on ADC map (3/4), but in one patient, high signal intensity was shown at bilateral dentate nuclei on not only DWI but also ADC map. All the lesions in dentate, inferior colliculus, pons, and medullas had been resolved completely on follow-up MRIs in 5 patients, but in 1 patient of them, corpus D_D001927 persisted. CONCLUSIONS: Reversible D_D001927s could be considered as the characteristic for C_D008795-induced D_D001927, next to the dentate nucleus involvement.

title:Comparison of the respiratory effects of i.v. infusions of C_D009020 and regional analgesia by extradural block.
abstract:The incidence of postoperative respiratory D_D001049 was compared between five patients receiving a continuous i.v. infusion of C_D009020 (mean 73.6 mg) and five patients receiving a continuous extradural infusion of 0.25% C_D002045 (mean 192 mg) in the 24-h period following upper abdominal surgery. Monitoring consisted of airflow detection by a C_D002245 analyser, chest wall movement detected by pneumatic capsules, and continuous electrocardiograph recorded with a Holter ambulatory monitor. Both obstructive (P less than 0.05) and central D_D001049 (P less than 0.05) occurred more frequently in patients who had a C_D009020 infusion. There was also a higher incidence of D_D013610 (P less than 0.05) and D_D018879 (P less than 0.05) in the C_D009020 infusion group.

title:Magnetic resonance volumetry of the cerebellum in D_D004827 patients after C_D010672 D_D062787.
abstract:The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between C_D010672 medication and D_D002526 in patients who had experienced clinical intoxication. Five females and 6 males, 21-59 years of age, were examined with a 1.5-T whole-body system using a circular polarized head coil. Conventional spin echo images were acquired in the sagittal and transverse orientation. In addition, we performed a high-resolution 3D gradient echo, T1-weighted sequences at a 1-mm slice thickness. The images were subsequently processed to obtain volumetric data for the cerebellum. Cerebellar volume for the patient group ranged between 67.66 and 131.08 ml (mean 108.9 ml). In addition 3D gradient echo data sets from 10 healthy male and 10 healthy female age-matched volunteers were used to compare cerebellar volumes. Using linear regression we found that no correlation exists between D_D012640 duration, elevation of C_D010672 serum levels and cerebellar volume. However, multiple regression for the daily dosage, duration of C_D010672 treatment and cerebellar volume revealed a correlation of these parameters. We conclude that C_D010672 D_D062787 does not necessarily result in D_D002526 and it is unlikely that C_D010672 medication was the only cause of D_D002526 in the remaining patients. Quantitative morphometric studies of the cerebellum provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of D_D002526.

abstract:BACKGROUND: Cardiac troponins I (cTnI) and T (cTnT) have been shown to be highly sensitive and specific markers of D_D009202. We investigated the diagnostic value of cTnI and cTnT for the diagnosis of D_D009202 in a rat model of C_D004317 (C_D004317)-induced D_D009202, and we examined the relationship between serial cTnI and cTnT with the development of D_D006331 monitored by echocardiography and histological examinations in this model. METHODS: Thirty-five Wistar rats were given 1.5 mg/kg C_D004317, i.v., weekly for up to 8 weeks for a total cumulative dose of 12 mg/kg BW. Ten rats received saline as a control group. cTnI was measured with Access(R) (ng/ml) and a research immunoassay (pg/ml), and compared with cTnT, CK-MB mass and CK. By using transthoracic echocardiography, anterior and posterior wall thickness, LV diameters and LV fractional shortening (FS) were measured in all rats before C_D004317 or saline, and at weeks 6 and 9 after treatment in all surviving rats. Histology was performed in C_D004317-rats at 6 and 9 weeks after the last C_D004317 dose and in all controls. RESULTS: Eighteen of the C_D004317 rats died prematurely of general D_D064420 during the 9-week period. End-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) LV diameters/BW significantly increased, whereas LV FS was decreased after 9 weeks in the C_D004317 group (p<0.001). These parameters remained unchanged in controls. Histological evaluation of hearts from all rats given C_D004317 revealed significant slight degrees of perivascular and interstitial D_D005355. In 7 of the 18 rats, degeneration and myocyte vacuolisation were found. Only five of the controls exhibited evidence of very slight perivascular D_D005355. A significant rise in cTnT was found in C_D004317 rats after cumulative doses of 7.5 and 12 mg/kg in comparison with baseline (p<0.05). cTnT found in rats after 12 mg/kg were significantly greater than that found after 7.5 mg/kg C_D004317. Maximal cTnI (pg/ml) and cTnT levels were significantly increased in C_D004317 rats compared with controls (p=0.006, 0.007). cTnI (ng/ml), CK-MB mass and CK remained unchanged in C_D004317 rats compared with controls. All markers remained stable in controls. Analysis of data revealed a significant correlation between maximal cTnT and ED and ES LV diameters/BW (r=0.81 and 0.65; p<0.0001). A significant relationship was observed between maximal cTnT and the extent of myocardial morphological changes, and between LV diameters/BW and histological findings. CONCLUSIONS: Among markers of D_D017202 after C_D004317 in rats, cTnT showed the greatest ability to detect D_D009202 assessed by echocardiographic detection and histological changes. Although there was a discrepancy between the amount of cTnI and cTnT after C_D004317, probably due to heterogeneity in cross-reactivities of mAbs to various cTnI and cTnT forms, it is likely that cTnT in rats after C_D004317 indicates cell damage determined by the magnitude of injury induced and that cTnT should be a useful marker for the prediction of experimentally induced cardioD_D064420 and possibly for cardioprotective experiments.

title:Calcineurin-inhibitor induced D_D010146 syndrome (D_-1): a severe disabling complication after organ transplantation.
abstract:Bone D_D010146 after transplantation is a frequent complication that can be caused by several diseases. Treatment strategies depend on the correct diagnosis of the D_D010146. Nine patients with severe D_D010146 in their feet, which was registered after transplantation, were investigated. Bone scans showed an increased tracer uptake of the foot bones. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated bone marrow oedema in the D_D010146ful bones. D_D010146 was not explained by other diseases causing foot D_D010146, like D_D012019, D_D011115, D_D009437, D_D006073, D_D010024, D_D010020, D_D007383, orthopaedic D_D005530, D_D015775, and D_D006961. The reduction of C_D016572- or C_D016559 trough levels and the administration of C_D002118 channel blockers led to relief of D_D010146. The Calcineurin-inhibitor Induced D_D010146 Syndrome (D_-1) is a rare but severe side effect of C_D016572 or C_D016559 and is accurately diagnosed by its typical presentation, magnetic resonance imaging and bone scans. Incorrect diagnosis of the syndrome will lead to a significant reduction of life quality in patients suffering from D_-1.

title:The haemodynamic effects of C_D015742 in combination with C_D004809 in elderly patients (ASA groups 3 and 4).
abstract:The marked vasodilator and negative inotropic effects of C_D015742 are disadvantages in frail elderly patients. We investigated the safety and efficacy of adding different doses of C_D004809 to C_D015742 in order to obtund the D_D007022 response. The haemodynamic effects of adding 15, 20 or 25 mg of C_D004809 to 200 mg of C_D015742 were compared to control in 40 ASA 3/4 patients over 60 years presenting for genito-urinary surgery. The addition of C_D004809 to C_D015742 appears to be an effective method of obtunding the D_D007022 response to C_D015742 at all doses used in this study. However, marked D_D013610 associated with the use of C_D004809 in combination with C_D015742 occurred in the majority of patients, occasionally reaching high levels in individual patients. Due to the risk of this D_D013610 inducing D_D017202, we would not recommend the use in elderly patients of any of the C_D004809/C_D015742/mixtures studied.

title:D_D020258 of C_D006912: clinical analysis of cases reported outside Japan.
abstract:An analysis is presented of 220 cases of possible D_D020258 reactions to C_D006912 reported from outside Japan. In 80 cases insufficient information was available for adequate comment and in 29 a relationship to the administration of C_D007464 could be excluded. Of the remainder, a relationship to C_D007464 was considered probable in 42 and possible in 69 cases. In six of the probable cases the D_D009422 consisted of an acute reversible D_D001927 usually related to the ingestion of a high dose of C_D007464 over a short period. The most common manifestation, observed in 15 further cases, was isolated D_D009896. This was most frequently found in children, many of whom had received C_D007464 as treatment for D_C538178. In the remaining cases, a combination of D_D013118, D_D014786, and D_D010523 was the most common manifestation. Isolated D_D013118 or D_D010523, or these manifestations occurring together, were infrequent. The onset of all manifestations (except toxic D_D001927) was usually subacute, with subsequent partial recovery. Older subjects tended to display more side effects. The full syndrome of subacute myelo-optic neuropathy was more frequent in women, but they tended to have taken greater quantities of the drug.

title:D_D004827 following cortical application of fibrin sealants containing C_D014148 in rats.
abstract:BACKGROUND: Fibrin sealants (FS) derived from human plasma are frequently used in neurosurgery. In order to increase clot stability, FS typically contain aprotinin, a natural fibrinolysis inhibitor. Recently, synthetic fibrinolysis inhibitors such as C_D014148 (C_D014148) have been considered as substitutes for aprotinin. However, C_D014148 has been shown to cause D_D004827. We wanted to study whether C_D014148 retains its D_D012640 action if incorporated into a FS. METHOD: FS containing aprotinin or different concentrations of C_D014148 (0.5-47.5 mg/ml) were applied to the pial surface of the cortex of anaesthetized rats. The response of the animals was evaluated using electroencephalography and by monitoring the clinical behaviour during and after recovery from anaesthesia. FINDINGS: FS containing C_D014148 caused paroxysmal brain activity which was associated with distinct D_D012640 behaviours. The degree of these D_D012640 increased with increasing concentration of C_D014148. Thus, FS containing 47.5 mg/ml C_D014148 evoked generalized D_D012640 in all tested rats (n=6) while the lowest concentration of C_D014148 (0.5 mg/ml) only evoked brief episodes of jerk-correlated D_D012640 potentials in 1 of 6 rats. In contrast, FS containing aprotinin did not evoke any paroxysmal activity. INTERPRETATION: C_D014148 retains its D_D012640 action within FS. Thus, use of FS containing C_D014148 for surgery within or close to the CNS may pose a substantial risk to the patient.

title:A diet promoting D_D019966 causes D_D006948 to a low dose of C_D000661.
abstract:Previous research in this laboratory has shown that a diet of intermittent excessive sugar consumption produces a state with neurochemical and behavioral similarities to D_D019966. The present study examined whether female rats on various regimens of sugar access would show D_D006948 to a low dose of C_D000661. After a 30-min baseline measure of locomotor activity (day 0), animals were maintained on a cyclic diet of 12-h deprivation followed by 12-h access to 10% C_D013395 solution and chow pellets (12 h access starting 4 h after onset of the dark period) for 21 days. Locomotor activity was measured again for 30 min at the beginning of days 1 and 21 of sugar access. Beginning on day 22, all rats were maintained on ad libitum chow. Nine days later locomotor activity was measured in response to a single low dose of C_D000661 (0.5 mg/kg). The animals that had experienced cyclic C_D013395 and chow were D_D006948 in response to C_D000661 compared with four control groups (ad libitum 10% C_D013395 and chow followed by C_D000661 injection, cyclic chow followed by C_D000661 injection, ad libitum chow with C_D000661, or cyclic 10% C_D013395 and chow with a saline injection). These results suggest that a diet comprised of alternating deprivation and access to a sugar solution and chow produces bingeing on sugar that leads to a long lasting state of increased sensitivity to C_D000661, possibly due to a lasting alteration in the C_D004298 system.

title:C_D010396-induced D_D001018 in rats. The effect of high dose C_D010396 treatment on aortic permeability to albumin and on the ultrastructure of the vessel.
abstract:Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with C_D010396 (C_D010396) 500 mg/kg/day for 10 or 42 days. Pair fed rats served as controls. Changes in aortic morphology were examined by light- and transmission-electron microscopy (TEM). In addition, the endothelial permeability and the penetration through the aortic wall of albumin were studied 10 minutes, 24 and 48 hours after i. v. injection of human serum 131I-albumin (131I-HSA). TEM revealed extensive elastolysis in the arterial wall of C_D010396-treated rats, consistent with an inhibitory effect on crosslink formation. In experimental animals excess deposition of collagen and glycoaminoglycans was observed in the subendothelial and medial layer of the aortic wall, together with prominent basal membrane substance around aortic smooth muscle cells. The aorta/serum-ratio and the radioactive build-up 24 and 48 hours after injection of 131I-HSA was reduced in animals treated with C_D010396 for 42 days, indicating an impeded transmural transport of tracer which may be caused by a steric exclusion effect of abundant C_D006820. The endothelial ultrastructure was unaffected by C_D010396, and no differences in aortic 131I-HSA radioactivity or aorta/serum-ratio were recorded between experimental and control groups 10 minutes after tracer injection, indicating that the permeability of the endothelial barrier to albumin remained unaffected by C_D010396 treatment. These observations support the hypothesis that treatment with high doses of C_D010396 may induce a fibroproliferative response in rat aorta, possibly by an inhibitory effect on the cross-linking of collagen and elastin.

title:Brain natriuretic peptide is a predictor of C_D018943-induced D_D066126.
abstract:C_D018943 are effective antineoplastic drugs, but they frequently cause dose-related D_D066126. The D_D066126 of conventional C_D018943 therapy highlights a need to search for methods that are highly sensitive and capable of predicting D_D006331. We measured the plasma level of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) to determine whether BNP might serve as a simple diagnostic indicator of C_D018943-induced D_D066126 in patients with D_D015470 treated with a C_D003630 (C_D003630)-containing regimen. Thirteen patients with D_D015470 were treated with a C_D003630-containing regimen. Cardiac functions were evaluated with radionuclide angiography before chemotherapies. The plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and BNP were measured at the time of radionuclide angiography. Three patients developed D_D006333 after the completion of chemotherapy. Five patients were diagnosed as having subclinical D_D006333 after the completion of chemotherapy. The plasma levels of BNP in all the patients with clinical and subclinical D_D006333 increased above the normal limit (40 pg/ml) before the detection of clinical or subclinical D_D006333 by radionuclide angiography. On the other hand, BNP did not increase in the patients without D_D006333 given C_D003630, even at more than 700 mg/m(2). The plasma level of ANP did not always increase in all the patients with clinical and subclinical D_D006333. These preliminary results suggest that BNP may be useful as an early and sensitive indicator of C_D018943-induced D_D066126.

title:Antibacterial medication use during pregnancy and risk of D_D000014: National D_D000014 Prevention Study.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association between antibacterial medications and selected D_D000014. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based, multisite, case-control study of women who had pregnancies affected by 1 of more than 30 eligible major D_D000014 identified via D_D000014 surveillance programs in 10 states (n = 13 155) and control women randomly selected from the same geographical regions (n = 4941). MAIN EXPOSURE: Reported maternal use of antibacterials (1 month before pregnancy through the end of the first trimester). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Odds ratios (ORs) measuring the association between antibacterial use and selected D_D000014 adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: The reported use of antibacterials increased during pregnancy, peaking during the third month. C_D013449 were associated with D_D000757 (adjusted OR [AOR] = 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-8.8), D_D018636 (AOR = 3.2; 95% CI, 1.3-7.6), D_D001017 (AOR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.3-5.6), D_D002754 (AOR = 8.0; 95% CI, 2.7-23.5), D_D017880 (AOR = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.0-5.9), and D_D006548 (AOR = 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1-5.4). C_D009582 were associated with D_D000853 or D_D008850 (AOR = 3.7; 95% CI, 1.1-12.2), D_D018636 (AOR = 4.2; 95% CI, 1.9-9.1), D_D006344 (AOR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.4), and D_D002971 with D_D002972 (AOR = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2-3.9). Other antibacterial agents that showed associations included C_D004917 (2 defects), C_D010406 (1 defect), C_D002511 (1 defect), and C_D015363 (1 defect). CONCLUSIONS: Reassuringly, C_D010406, C_D004917, and C_D002511, although used commonly by pregnant women, were not associated with many D_D000014. C_D013449 and C_D009582 were associated with several D_D000014, indicating a need for additional scrutiny.

title:Incidence of D_D009369 in patients with D_D001172 exposed to different treatment regimens.
abstract:Immunosuppressive drugs have been used during the last 30 years in treatment of patients with severe D_D001172. The drugs commonly used are C_D003520 and C_D002699 (C_D000477), C_D001379 (C_D011687 analogue), and C_D008727 (C_D005492 analogue). There is evidence that all four immunosuppressive drugs can reduce D_D013585, but disease activity almost always recurs after therapy is stopped. Since adverse reactions are frequent, less than 50 percent of patients are able to continue a particular drug for more than one year. Since it takes three to 12 months to achieve maximal effects, those patients who are unable to continue the drug receive little benefit from it. Patients treated with C_D000477 have an increased risk of development of D_D015470, and both C_D000477 and C_D001379 are associated with the development of D_D008228. C_D003520 therapy increases the risk of carcinoma of the bladder. There have been several long-term studies of patients with D_D001172 treated with C_D001379 and C_D003520 and the incidence of most of the common D_D009369 is not increased. Data on the possible increased risk of D_D009369 in D_D001172 are still being collected, and until further information is available, the use of immunosuppressive drugs, particularly C_D000477, in the treatment of D_D001172 should be reserved for patients with severe progressive disease or life-threatening complications.

title:Patterns of D_D056486 induced by C_D008750.
abstract:Twelve patients with D_D008107 related to C_D008750 were seen between 1967 and 1977. Illness occurred within 1--9 weeks of commencement of therapy in 9 patients, the remaining 3 patients having received the drug for 13 months, 15 months and 7 years before experiencing symptoms. D_D007565 with tender D_D006529, usually preceded by symptoms of malaise, D_D000855, D_D009325 and D_D014839, and associated with upper D_D015746, was an invariable finding in all patients. Biochemical liver function tests indicated hepatocellular D_D009336 and correlated with histopathological evidence of D_D056486, the spectrum of which ranged from D_D005234 and focal hepatocellular D_D009336 to massive hepatic D_D009336. Most patients showed moderate to severe D_D017114 or D_D006521 with associated D_D002779. The drug was withdrawn on presentation to hospital in 11 patients, with rapid clinical improvement in 9. One patient died, having presented in D_D017093, and another, who had been taking C_D008750 for 7 years, showed slower clinical and biochemical resolution over a period of several months. The remaining patient in the series developed D_D017114 when the drug was accidentally recommenced 1 year after a prior episode of C_D008750-induced D_D056486. In this latter patient, and in 2 others, the causal relationship between C_D008750 and D_D008107 was proved with the recurrence of D_D056486 within 2 weeks of re-exposure to the drug.

title:A phase I/II study of C_D017239 plus C_D002945 as first-line therapy for D_D006258: preliminary results.
abstract:Improved outcomes among patients with D_D006258 require investigations of new drugs for induction therapy. Preliminary results of an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study of single-agent C_D017239 (C_D017239; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) reported a 37% response rate in patients with D_D006258, and the C_D017239/C_D002945 combination has been used successfully and has significantly improved median response duration in D_D010051 patients. We initiated a phase I/II trial to determine the response and D_D064420 of escalating C_D017239 doses combined with fixed-dose C_D002945 with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support in patients with untreated locally advanced inoperable D_D006258. To date, 23 men with a median age of 50 years and good performance status have entered the trial. Primary D_D009369 sites were oropharynx, 10 patients; hypopharynx, four; larynx, two; oral cavity, three; unknown primary, two; and nasal cavity and parotid gland, one each. Of 20 patients evaluable for D_D064420, four had stage III and 16 had stage IV disease. Treatment, given every 21 days for a maximum of three cycles, consisted of C_D017239 by 3-hour infusion followed the next day by a fixed dose of C_D002945 (75 mg/m2). The dose levels incorporate escalating C_D017239 doses, and intrapatient escalations within a given dose level are permitted if D_D064420 permits. At the time of this writing, dose level 4 (260, 270, and 280 mg/m2) is being evaluated; three patients from this level are evaluable. With C_D017239 doses of 200 mg/m2 and higher, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 5 micrograms/kg/d is given (days 4 through 12). Of 18 patients evaluable for response, seven (39%) achieved a complete response and six (33%) achieved a partial response. Three patients had no change and disease progressed in two. The overall response rate is 72%. Eleven responding patients had subsequent surgery/radiotherapy or radical radiotherapy. Two pathologic complete responses were observed in patients who had achieved clinical complete responses. D_D000505, D_D010292, and D_D018771/D_D063806 have occurred frequently, but with one exception (a grade 3 D_D063806) they have been grade 1 or 2. No dose-limiting hematologic D_D064420 has been seen. C_D017239/C_D002945 is an effective first-line regimen for locoregionally advanced D_D006258 and continued study is warranted. Results thus far suggest no dose-response effect for C_D017239 doses above 200 mg/m2.

title:A phase I study of C_C027260. Clinical pharmacology and pharmacokinetics.
abstract:A Phase I study of intravenous (IV) bolus C_C027260 (C_C027260) was done in 55 patients in good performance status with refractory D_D009369. Twenty-six had minimal prior therapy (good risk), 23 had extensive prior therapy (poor risk), and six had renal and/or D_D008107. A total of 167 courses at doses of 15 to 70 mg/m2 were evaluable. Maximum tolerated dose in good-risk patients was 70 mg/m2, and in poor-risk patients, 60 mg/m2. The dose-limiting toxic effect was transient noncumulative D_D000380. Granulocyte nadir was on day 14 (range, 4-22). Less frequent toxic effects included D_D013921, D_D000740, D_D009325, mild D_D000505, D_D010689, and D_D052016. D_D001855 was more in patients with D_D008107. Pharmacokinetic analyses in 21 patients revealed C_C027260 plasma T 1/2 alpha (+/- SE) of 2.5 +/- 0.85 minutes, T beta 1/2 of 25.6 +/- 6.5 minutes, and T 1/2 gamma of 23.6 +/- 7.6 hours. The area under the curve was 537 +/- 149 ng/ml x hours, volume of distribution (Vd) 3504 +/- 644 l/m2, and total clearance (ClT) was 204 + 39.3 l/hour/m2. C_C010013, C_D004317, C_C010012, and C_C027260 were the metabolites detected in plasma and the amount of C_D004317 was less than or equal to 10% of the total metabolites. Urinary excretion of C_C027260 in the first 24 hours was less than or equal to 10%. Activity was noted in D_D008654, D_D007890, and D_D002280. The recommended starting dose for Phase II trials is 60 mg/m2 IV bolus every 3 weeks.

title:Differential effects of C_D001556 (C_D001556) on pharmacologically-induced D_D012640.
abstract:C_D001556 (C_D001556), the active ingredient of the insecticide C_D001556, has been shown to decrease D_D012640 threshold to pentylenetrazol (C_D010433) 3 h after exposure to C_D001556 and conversely increase threshold to C_D010433-induced D_D012640 24 h after exposure to C_D001556 (Vohland et al. 1981). In this study, the severity of response to other D_D012640-inducing agents was tested in mice 1 and 24 h after intraperitoneal administration of 80 mg/kg C_D001556. One hour after the administration of C_D001556, the activity of D_D012640-inducing agents was increased, regardless of their mechanism, while 24 h after C_D001556 a differential response was observed. D_D012640 activity due to C_D010433 and C_D010852 (C_D010852) was significantly decreased; however, D_D012640 activity due to C_D015097 (C_D015097), C_D001640 (C_D001640), C_C034818 (C_C034818), or C_D013331 (C_D013331) was not different from control. In vitro, C_D001556, C_D010433 and C_D010852 were shown to inhibit C_C046308 binding in mouse whole brain, with IC50 values of 4.6, 404 and 9.4 microM, respectively. C_D015097, C_D001640, C_C034818, and C_D013331 showed no inhibition of C_C046308 (C_C046308) binding at concentrations of 100 micron. The pharmacological challenge data suggest that tolerance may occur to D_D012640 activity induced by C_D010433 and C_D010852 24 h after C_D001556, since the response to only these two D_D012640-inducing agents is decreased. The in vitro data suggest that the site responsible for the decrease in D_D012640 activity 24 h after C_D001556 may be the C_D005680-A receptor-linked chloride channel.

title:Severe ocular and orbital D_D064420 after intracarotid injection of C_D016190 for recurrent D_D005909.
abstract:BACKGROUND: D_D005909 is a D_D009369 that occurs in the cerebrum during adulthood. With current treatment regimens including combined surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, the average life expectancy of the patients is limited to approximately 1 year. Therefore, patients with D_D005909 sometimes have intracarotid injection of carcinostatics added to the treatment regimen. Generally, C_D016190 is said to have milder side effects than C_D002945, whose ocular and orbital D_D064420 are well known. However, we experienced a case of severe ocular and orbital D_D064420 after intracarotid injection of C_D016190, which is infrequently reported. CASE: A 58-year-old man received an intracarotid injection of C_D016190 for recurrent D_D005909 in his left temporal lobe. He complained of pain and visual disturbance in the ipsilateral eye 30 h after the injection. Various ocular symptoms and findings caused by C_D016190 D_D064420 were seen. RESULTS: He was treated with intravenous administration of corticosteroids and C_D005990 for 6 days after the injection. Although the intraocular pressure elevation caused by secondary acute angle-closure D_D005901 decreased and D_D058447 diminished, inexorable D_D010211 and exudative D_D012163 continued for 3 weeks. Finally, 6 weeks later, diffuse D_C566236 with D_D009896 occurred and the vision in his left eye was lost. CONCLUSION: When performing intracarotid injection of C_D016190, we must be aware of its potentially blinding ocular D_D064420. It is recommended that further studies and investigations are undertaken in the effort to minimize such severe side effects.

title:Phase II study of the C_D000677 analogue C_C042315 (C_C042315) in D_D002289.
abstract:C_C042315 (C_C042315; C_C042315) is a topoisomerase II poison with high experimental antiD_D009369 activity. It was administered by 15 min infusion to 16 evaluable patients with D_D002289 (D_D002289) (7 with no prior treatment, 9 patients in relapse following surgery/radiotherapy) at a dose (648 mg/m2 divided over 3 days, repeated every 3 weeks) determined by phase I trial. Patients had a median performance status of 1 (WHO), and median age of 61 years. The histology comprised D_D002294 (11), D_D000230 (1), mixed histology (2), D_D002282 (1) and large cell D_D002277 (1). D_D009503 grade greater than or equal to 3 was seen in 15 patients, D_D007239 with recovery in 3, and grand mal D_D012640 in 1 patient. Grade less than or equal to 2 D_D009325 and D_D014839 occurred in 66% courses and D_D010689 in the infusion arm in 37%. 1 patient with D_D002294 achieved a partial response lasting 5 months. Further testing in this and other D_D009369 types using multiple daily schedules is warranted.

title:C_D008063 prevents D_D028361 and D_D020258 in experimental chemotherapy D_D009422.
abstract:The study investigates if C_D008063 is neuroprotective against chemotherapy induced D_D020258, if D_D028361 plays a critical role in D_D009410, and if neuroprotective effects of C_D008063 depend on mitochondria protection. We used an in vitro model of chemotherapy induced peripheral D_D009422 that closely mimic the in vivo condition by exposing primary cultures of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons to C_D017239 and C_D002945, two widely used and highly effective chemotherapeutic drugs. This approach allowed investigating the efficacy of C_D008063 in preventing D_D001480 and apoptosis and the function and ultrastructural morphology of mitochondria after exposure to toxic agents and C_D008063. Our results demonstrate that both C_D002945 and C_D017239 cause early D_D028361 with loss of membrane potential and induction of autophagic vacuoles in neurons. C_D008063 exerts neuroprotective effects against chemotherapy induced D_D020258 in sensory neurons: it rescues the D_D028361 and induces the expression of frataxin, an essential mitochondrial protein with anti-oxidant and chaperone properties. In conclusion D_D028361 is an early common event both in C_D017239 and C_D002945 induced D_D020258. C_D008063 protects sensory neurons through its anti-oxidant and mitochondrial regulatory functions, possibly inducing the expression of frataxin. These findings suggest that C_D008063 might reduce the risk of developing D_D010523 in patients undergoing chemotherapy and encourage further confirmatory clinical trials.

title:Optimising D_D020521 prevention in non-valvular D_D001281.
abstract:D_D001281 is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Pooled data from trials comparing antithrombotic treatment with placebo have shown that C_D014859 reduces the risk of D_D020521 by 62%, and that C_D001241 alone reduces the risk by 22%. Overall, in high-risk patients, C_D014859 is superior to C_D001241 in preventing D_D020521s, with a relative risk reduction of 36%. C_C426686, an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, was found to be as efficient as C_D014812 antagonist drugs in the prevention of D_D004617, but has been recently withdrawn because of D_D056486 tests. The ACTIVE-W (D_D001281 C_C055162 Trial with C_C081309 for Prevention of Vascular Events) study has demonstrated that C_D014859 is superior to platelet therapy (C_C055162 plus C_D001241) in the prevention af D_D004617. C_C479958, a Factor Xa inhibitor, is being evaluated in patients with D_D001281. C_D000809-converting enzyme inhibitors and C_D000804 receptor-blocking drugs hold promise in D_D001281 through D_D020257. Preliminary studies suggest that C_D019821 could interfere with the risk of recurrence after electrical cardioversion. Finally, percutaneous methods for the exclusion of left atrial appendage are under investigation in high-risk patients.

title:Interaction of C_D016572 with antineoplastic agents.
abstract:A synergistic effect of C_D005047 and C_D016572 was observed in a patient with D_D054218 in relapse. The concomitant administration of C_D005047 and C_D016572 resulted in eradication of hitherto refractory D_D017254 of bone marrow. Severe side effects in terms of mental D_D003221 and progressive D_D006932, however, point to an enhancement not only of antineoplastic effects but also of D_D064420 in normal tissues. This report demonstrates for the first time that the pharmacodynamic properties of C_D016572 may not be confined strictly to suppression of normal T-cell functions.

title:The hematologic effects of C_D015790 and C_C021341 in the dog: a potential model of C_D002511 D_D006402 in man.
abstract:C_D002511 antibiotics cause a variety of D_D006402 in man, the pathogeneses and hematopathology of which remain poorly characterized. There is a need for a well-defined animal model in which these D_D006402 can be studied. In four subacute D_D064420 studies, the intravenous administration of C_D015790 or C_C021341 to beagle dogs caused a dose-dependent incidence of D_D000740, D_D009503, and D_D013921 after 1-3 months of treatment. A nonregenerative D_D000740 was the most compromising of the D_D006402 and occurred in approximately 50% of dogs receiving 400-500 mg/kg C_D015790 or 540-840 mg/kg C_C021341. All three D_D006402 were completely reversible following cessation of treatment; the time required for recovery of the erythron (approximately 1 month) was considerably longer than that of the granulocytes and platelets (hours to a few days). Upon rechallenge with either C_D002511, the D_D006402 was reproduced in most dogs tested; C_D015790 (but not C_C021341)-treated dogs showed a substantially reduced induction period (15 +/- 5 days) compared to that of the first exposure to the drug (61 +/- 24 days). This observation, along with the rapid rate of decline in red cell mass parameters of affected dogs, suggests that a D_D006461 component complicated the red cell production problem and that multiple toxicologic mechanisms contributed to the D_D006402. We conclude that the administration of high doses of C_D015790 or C_C021341 to dogs can induce D_D006402 similar to the C_D002511-induced D_D006402 described in man and thus provides a useful model for studying the mechanisms of these disorders.

title:A C_D011736-dependent D_D002653 unmasked by C_D007538.
abstract:A 3-year-old girl had D_D002653, with D_D006948, D_D001523, and D_D012893 after the therapeutic administration of C_D007538. The administration of pharmacologic doses of C_D011736 hydrochloride led to a disappearance of symptoms. After discontinuing C_D007538 therapy a similar pattern of behavior was noted that was controlled by C_D011736. A placebo had no effect, but C_D009536 was as effective as C_D011736. Periodic withdrawal of C_D011736 was associated with return of the D_D006948. The level of C_D011730 in the blood was normal during the periods of relapse. Metabolic studies suggested a block in the C_D007737 pathway of C_D014364 metabolism. The patient has been followed for six years and has required pharmacologic doses of C_D011736 to control her behavior.

title:A selective C_D004298 D4 receptor antagonist, C_C121249: a preclinical neuropharmacological profile.
abstract:C_C121249, C_C121249, has a high affinity for human cloned C_D004298 D4.2, D4.4 and D4.7 receptors, with Ki values of 0.5, 0.9 and 2.7 nM, respectively. C_C121249 is over 20,000fold more potent at the C_D004298 D4.2 receptor compared with the human cloned C_D004298 D2L receptor. C_C121249 has negligible affinity for the human cloned C_D004298 D3 receptor (Ki=39 nM), rat C_D012701 (C_D012701)2A receptors (Ki=180 nM) and rat alpha1 adrenoceptor (Ki=237 nM). C_C121249 and C_D003024 antagonized locomotor D_D006948 induced by C_D008694 (C_D008694) in mice. C_C121249 and C_D003024 antagonized C_D008694-induced stereotyped behavior in mice, although their effects did not exceed 50% inhibition, even at the highest dose given. C_C121249 and C_D003024 significantly induced D_D002375 in rats, although their effects did not exceed 50% induction even at the highest dose given. C_C121249 and C_D003024 significantly reversed the disruption of prepulse inhibition (PPI) in rats produced by C_D001058. C_C121249 and C_D003024 significantly shortened the C_D010622 (C_D010622)-induced prolonged swimming latency in rats in a water maze task. These findings suggest that C_C121249 may have unique antipsychotic activities without the liability of motor side effects typical of classical antipsychotics.

abstract:We report the case of a patient in whom C_D014217-induced D_D056486 was followed by prolonged anicteric D_D002779. D_D007565 occurred after administration of C_D014217 for 7 days and was associated with D_D004802. D_D007565 disappeared within 3 months but was followed by prolonged anicteric D_D002779 marked by D_D011537 and high levels of alkaline phosphatase and gammaglutamyltransferase activities. Finally, D_D011537 disappeared within 19 months, and liver tests returned to normal 27 months after the onset of D_D056486. This observation demonstrates that prolonged D_D002779 can follow C_D014217-induced acute D_D056486.

title:HMG CoA reductase inhibitors. Current clinical experience.
abstract:C_D008148 and C_D019821 are the 2 best-known members of the class of hypolipidaemic agents known as HMG CoA reductase inhibitors. Clinical experience with C_D008148 includes over 5000 patients, 700 of whom have been treated for 2 years or more, and experience with C_D019821 includes over 3500 patients, of whom 350 have been treated for 18 months or more. C_D008148 has been marketed in the United States for over 6 months. Both agents show substantial clinical efficacy, with reductions in total C_D002784 of over 30% and in LDL-C_D002784 of 40% in clinical studies. Modest increases in HDL-C_D002784 levels of about 10% are also reported. Clinical tolerability of both agents has been good, with fewer than 3% of patients withdrawn from treatment because of clinical adverse experiences. Ophthalmological examinations in over 1100 patients treated with one or the other agent have revealed no evidence of significant short term (up to 2 years) cataractogenic potential. One to 2% of patients have elevations of serum transaminases to greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal. These episodes are asymptomatic and reversible when therapy is discontinued. Minor elevations of C_D003401 kinase levels are reported in about 5% of patients. D_D009135, associated in some cases with D_D009212, and in 2 cases with transient D_D051437, has been rarely reported with C_D008148, especially in patients concomitantly treated with C_D016572, C_D015248 or C_D009525. C_D008148 and C_D019821 are both effective and well-tolerated agents for lowering elevated levels of serum C_D002784. As wider use confirms their safety profile, they will gain increasing importance in the therapeutic approach to hyperC_D002784aemia and its consequences.

abstract:D_D011014, bilateral D_D010996, echocardiographic evidence of D_D002305, and positive autoantibodies developed in a 43-year-old man, who was receiving long-term C_D012460 therapy for chronic D_D003093. After cessation of the C_D012460 and completion of a six-week course of corticosteroids, these problems resolved over a period of four to six months. It is suggested that the patient had C_D012460-induced D_D008180, which manifested with D_D012700 and pulmonary parenchymal involvement in the absence of joint symptoms. Physicians who use C_D012460 to treat patients with D_D015212 should be aware of the signs of C_D012460-induced D_D008180 syndrome.

title:Optimization of C_D007980 therapy.
abstract:While there is no single correct starting dose for C_D007980 therapy, many individuals can be started on either the 25/100 or controlled-release formula, following the general rule not to attempt to titrate C_D002230-C_D007980 to the point of "normality," which can lead to D_D064420. The physician should also determine the proper use of any adjunctive medications; such combined therapy has become the standard approach to treatment. Following the initial period of therapy, emerging difficulties require a reassessment of therapeutic approaches, such as dosage adjustment or introduction of a C_D004298 agonist. Other possible adverse effects--such as D_D005767, D_D007024, C_D007980-induced D_D011618, D_D012893 or D_D020447, or drug interactions--also require carefully monitored individual treatment. Nonpharmacologic concerns can help the D_D010300 patient achieve and maintain optimal functioning, including daily exercise, physical therapy, and involvement with support groups.

abstract:Four patients who were rendered D_D003128tose or D_D053608 by drug intoxication, but who were not hypoxic, are described. Three patients received high doses of C_D002719 for C_D000431 D_D013375, and one took a suicidal D_D062787 of C_D009567. The patient with C_D009567 D_D062787 and two of those with C_D002719 intoxication conformed to the criteria of 'alpha D_D003128', showing non-reactive generalized or frontally predominant alpha activity in the EEG. The fourth patient who was unconscious after C_D002719 administration exhibite generalized non-reactive activity in the slow beta range. All four recovered completely without D_D009422 following the withdrawal of the offending agents. The similarities between the effects of structural lesions and pharmacological D_D003866 of the brain stem reticular formation are discussed. It is suggested that in both situations disturbed reticulo-thalamic interactions are important in the pathogenesis of alpha D_D003128. It is concluded that when this electroencephalographic and behavioural picture is seen in drug intoxication, in the absence of significant D_D000860, a favourable outcome may be anticipated.

title:Omitting C_D005283 reduces D_D009325 and D_D014839, without increasing D_D010146, after C_C009250 for day surgery.
abstract:BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Despite advantages of induction and maintenance of anaesthesia with C_C009250, postoperative D_D009325 and D_D014839 occurs frequently. C_D005283 is a commonly used supplement that may contribute to this, although it may also improve analgesia. METHODS: This double-blind study examined the incidence and severity of postoperative D_D009325 and D_D014839 and D_D010146 in the first 24 h after C_C009250 anaesthesia in 216 adult day surgery patients. Patients were randomly allocated to either receive or not receive 1 1 C_D005283, while a third group received C_D003907 in addition to C_D005283. RESULTS: Omission of C_D005283 did not reduce the overall incidence of postoperative D_D009325 and D_D014839, but did reduce the incidence of D_D014839 and/or moderate to severe D_D009325 prior to discharge from 20% and 17% with C_D005283 and C_D005283-C_D003907, respectively, to 5% (P = 0.013). Antiemetic requirements were reduced from 24% and 31% to 7% (P = 0.0012). C_D003907 had no significant effect on the incidence or severity of postoperative D_D009325 and D_D014839. Combining the two C_D005283 groups revealed further significant benefits from the avoidance of opioids, reducing postoperative D_D009325 and D_D014839 and D_D009325 prior to discharge from 35% and 33% to 22% and 19% (P = 0.049 and P = 0.035), respectively, while D_D009325 in the first 24 h was decreased from 42% to 27% (P = 0.034). D_D010146 severity and analgesic requirements were unaffected by the omission of C_D005283. C_D005283 did reduce minor intraoperative movement but had no C_C009250-sparing effect and increased D_D012131, D_D007022 and D_D001919. CONCLUSION: As C_D005283 exacerbated postoperative D_D009325 and D_D014839 without an improvement in postoperative D_D010146 and also had adverse cardiorespiratory effects, it appears to be an unnecessary and possibly detrimental supplement to C_C009250 in day surgery.

title:D_D005198 and D_D009135 after liver transplantation: drug-related D_C540770?
abstract:Advances in the field of transplantation provide a better quality of life and allow more favorable conditions for growth and development in children. However, combinations of different therapeutic regimens require consideration of potential adverse reactions. We describe a 15-yr-old girl who had orthotopic liver transplantation because of D_D006527. C_D016559, C_-1, and C_D013256 were given as immunosuppressant. C_D019259 was added because of de nova D_D006509 during her follow-up. Three yr after transplantation she developed D_D005198 with severe D_D000138, D_D017674, D_D006029, and D_D000608. Although C_D016559 was suspected to be the cause of late post-transplant renal D_D000138 and was replaced by C_D020123, D_D000138, and electrolyte imbalance got worse. Proximal D_D018908 has developed during her follow-up. D_D005198, as well as D_D009135, is well recognized in patients with D_D028361 and caused by depletion of mtDNA. We suggest that our patient's D_D005198 and D_D009135 may have resulted from D_D028361 which is triggered by C_D016559 and augmented by C_D019259.

title:Antipsychotic-like profile of C_C052075, a selective H3-receptor antagonist in mice.
abstract:Experimental and clinical evidence points to a role of central C_D006632rgic system in the pathogenesis of D_D012559. The present study was designed to study the effect of C_D006632 H(3)-receptor ligands on neuroleptic-induced D_D002375, C_D001058-induced climbing behavior and C_D000661-induced locomotor activities in mice. D_D002375 was induced by C_D006220 (2 mg/kg p.o.), while C_D001058 (1.5 mg/kg s.c.) and C_D000661 (2 mg/kg s.c.) were used for studying climbing behavior and locomotor activities, respectively. (R)-alpha-methylC_D006632 (C_C069357) (5 microg i.c.v.) and C_C052075 (C_C052075) (15 mg/kg i.p.), per se did not cause D_D002375. Administration of C_C052075 (3.75, 7.5 and 15 mg/kg i.p.) 1 h prior to C_D006220 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the D_D002375 times (P < 0.05). However, pretreatment with C_C069357 significantly reversed such an effect of C_C052075 (15 mg/kg i.p.). C_C069357 per se showed significant reduction in locomotor time, distance traveled and average speed but C_C052075 (15 mg/kg i.p.) per se had no effect on these parameters. On C_D000661-induced D_D006948, C_C052075 (3.75 and 7.5 mg/kg i.p.) reduced locomotor time, distance traveled and average speed (P < 0.05). Pretreatment with C_C069357 (5 microg i.c.v.) could partially reverse such effects of C_C052075 (3.75 mg/kg i.p.). Climbing behavior induced by C_D001058 was reduced in animals treated with C_C052075. Such an effect was, however, reversed in presence of C_C069357. C_C052075 exhibited an antipsychotic-like profile by potentiating C_D006220-induced D_D002375, reducing C_D000661-induced D_D006948 and reducing C_D001058-induced climbing in mice. Such effects of C_C052075 were reversed by C_C069357 indicating the involvement of C_D006632 H(3)-receptors. Findings suggest a potential for H(3)-receptor antagonists in improving the refractory cases of D_D012559.

title:Transient D_-1 induced by C_D011405 D_D062787 in a young woman with D_D004437.
abstract:In this report we describe the case of a 37-year-old white woman with D_D004437, who developed a rare syndrome called D_-1, characterized by massive right-to-left interatrial shunting with transient profound D_D000860 and D_D003490. This shunt of blood via a D_D054092 occurred in the presence of a normal pulmonary artery pressure, and was probably precipitated by a C_D011405 D_D062787. This drug caused D_D018754, due to its negative inotropic effect, and D_D007022, due to its peripheral vasodilatory effect. These effects gave rise to an increase in the right atrial pressure and a decrease in the left one with a consequent stretching of the foramen ovale and the creation of massive right-to-left shunting. In our case this interatrial shunt was very accurately detected at bubble contrast echocardiography.

title:A Phase II trial of C_D002945 plus C_D004999 (C_D004999) for metastatic D_D001943: an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Study (E8188).
abstract:BACKGROUND: C_D002945 has minimal antiD_D009369 activity when used as second- or third-line treatment of metastatic D_D001943. Older reports suggest an objective response rate of 8% when 60-120 mg/m2 of C_D002945 is administered every 3-4 weeks. Although a dose-response effect has been observed with C_D002945, the dose-limiting D_D064420 associated with C_D002945 (e.g., D_D007674, D_D006311, and D_D020258) have limited its use as a treatment for D_D001943. C_D004999 or C_D004999 initially was developed to protect military personnel in the event of nuclear war. C_D004999 subsequently was shown to protect normal tissues from the toxic effects of C_D000477 and C_D002945 without decreasing the antiD_D009369 effect of the chemotherapy. Early trials of C_D002945 and C_D004999 also suggested that the incidence and severity of C_D002945-induced D_D007674, D_D006311, and D_D009422 were reduced. METHODS: A Phase II study of the combination of C_D002945 plus C_D004999 was conducted in patients with progressive metastatic D_D001943 who had received one, but not more than one, chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease. Patients received C_D004999, 910 mg/m2 intravenously over 15 minutes. After completion of the C_D004999 infusion, C_D002945 120 mg/m2 was administered over 30 minutes. Intravenous hydration and C_D008353 was administered before and after C_D002945. Treatment was administered every 3 weeks until disease progression. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were enrolled in the study of which 7 (16%) were ineligible. A median of 2 cycles of therapy was administered to the 37 eligible patients. Six partial responses were observed for an overall response rate of 16%. Most patients (57%) stopped treatment because of disease progression. D_D020258 was reported in 52% of patients. Seven different life-threatening D_D064420 were observed in patients while receiving treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of C_D002945 and C_D004999 in this study resulted in an overall response rate of 16%. Neither a D_D009369-protective effect nor reduced D_D064420 to normal tissues was observed with the addition of C_D004999 to C_D002945 in this trial.

Surgical exploration revealed an iliopsoas D_D006406 and femoral D_D009408, resulting in a D_D020428 and D_D009135. Anticoagulant-induced D_D020428 represents the most common form of C_D014859-induced D_D010523; it is characterized by severe D_D010146 in the inguinal region, varying degrees of D_D015417, and flexure D_D003286 of the involved extremity.

title:Components of lemon essential oil attenuate D_D003704 induced by C_D012601.
abstract:The anti-D_D003704 effects of C_C008281 and C_C032208 were observed using the passive avoidance test (PA) and the open field habituation test (OFH). These lemon essential oils showed strong ability to improve D_D008569 by C_D012601; however, C_C032208 relieved the D_D008569 in PA only, and did not improve non-associative memory significantly in OFH. Analysis of neurotransmitter concentration in some brain regions on the test day showed that C_D004298 concentration of the vehicle/C_D012601 group was significantly lower than that of the vehicle/vehicle group, but this phenomenon was reversed when C_C008281 or C_C032208 were administered before the injection of C_D012601. Simultaneously, we found that these two lemon essential oil components could inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity in vitro using the Ellman method.

title:The selective C_D0127016 receptor antagonist C_C507242 restores memory performance in cholinergic and serotonergic models of D_D008569 in the rat.
abstract:Antagonists at C_D012701 type 6 (C_D012701(6)) receptors show activity in models of learning and memory. Although the underlying mechanism(s) are not well understood, these effects may involve an increase in C_D000109 (C_D000109) levels. The present study sought to characterize the cognitive-enhancing effects of the C_D012701(6) antagonist C_C507242 (C_C507242) in a rat object recognition task employing a cholinergic (C_D012601 pretreatment) and a serotonergic- (C_D014364 (C_D014364) depletion) deficient model, and compared its pattern of action with that of the C_D000109sterase inhibitor C_D014236. Initial testing in a time-dependent forgetting task employing a 24-h delay between training and testing showed that C_D014236 improved object recognition (at 10 and 30 mg/kg, p.o.), whereas C_C507242 was inactive. Both, C_C507242 (3 and 10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)) and C_D014236 (10 mg/kg, p.o., respectively) reversed D_D008569 induced by C_D012601 and C_D014364 depletion (10 mg/kg, i.p., and 3 mg/kg, p.o., respectively). In conclusion, although C_C507242 did not improve a time-related retention deficit, it reversed a cholinergic and a serotonergic D_D008569, suggesting that both mechanisms may be involved in the facilitation of object memory by C_C507242 and, possibly, other C_D012701(6) receptor antagonists.

title:Lone D_D001281 associated with C_D003401 monohydrate supplementation.
abstract:D_D001281 in young patients without structural D_D006331 is rare. Therefore, when the D_D001145 is present in this population, reversible causes must be identified and resolved. D_D013959, illicit drug or stimulant use, and D_D000435 are among these causes. We report the case of a 30-year-old Caucasian man who came to the emergency department in D_D001281 with rapid ventricular response. His medical history was unremarkable, except for minor D_D050723 of the fingers and foot. Thyroid-stimulating hormone, C_D008274, and C_D011188 levels were within normal limits, urine drug screen was negative, and C_D000431 use was denied. However, when the patient was questioned about use of herbal products and supplements, the use of C_D003401 monohydrate was revealed. The patient was admitted to the hospital, anticoagulated with unfractionated C_D006493, and given intravenous C_D004110 for rate control and intravenous C_D000638 for rate and rhythm control. When discharged less than 24 hours later, he was receiving C_D008790 and C_D001241, with follow-up plans for echocardiography and nuclear imaging to assess perfusion. Exogenous C_D003401 is used by athletes to theoretically improve exercise performance. Vegetarians may also take C_D003401 to replace what they are not consuming from meat, fish, and other animal products. Previous anecdotal reports have linked C_D003401 to the development of D_D001145. Clinicians must be diligent when interviewing patients about their drug therapy histories and include questions about their use of herbal products and dietary supplements. In addition, it is important to report adverse effects associated with frequently consumed supplements and herbal products to the Food and Drug Administration and in the literature.

title:Comparison of developmental D_D064420 of selective and non-selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors in CRL:(WI)WUBR Wistar rats--C_C106876 and C_D010894 study.
abstract:BACKGROUND: Cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors are one of the most often ingested drugs during pregnancy. Unlike general D_D064420 data, their prenatal toxic effects were not extensively studied before. The aim of the experiment was to evaluate the developmental D_D064420 of the non-selective (C_D010894) and selective (C_C106876; C_C106876) COX-2 inhibitors. METHODS: Drugs were separately, orally once daily dosed to pregnant rats from day 8 to 21 (GD1=plug day). Doses were set at 0.3, 3.0 and 30.0mg/kg for C_D010894 and 0.2, 2.0 and 20.0mg/kg for C_C106876. Fetuses were delivered on GD 21 and routinely examined. Comprehensive clinical and developmental measurements were done. The pooled statistical analysis for ventricular septal (VSD) and midline (MD) defects was performed for rat fetuses exposed to C_D010894, selective and non-selective COX-2 inhibitor based on present and historic data. RESULTS: Maternal D_D064420, D_D005317, and D_D009139 were found in rats treated with the highest dose of C_D010894. Decrease of fetal length was the only signs of the C_C106876 developmental D_D064420 observed in pups exposed to the highest compound dose. Lack of teratogenicity was found in C_D010894 and C_C106876-exposed groups. Prenatal exposure to non-selective COX inhibitors increases the risk of VSD and MD when compared to historic control but not with selective COX-2 inhibitors. CONCLUSION: Both selective and non-selective COX-2 inhibitors were toxic for rats fetuses when administered in the highest dose. Unlike C_C106876, C_D010894 was also highly toxic to the dams. Prenatal exposure to selective COX-2 inhibitors does not increase the risk of ventricular septal and midline defects in rat when compared to non-selective drugs and historic control.

title:Protective efficacy of neuroactive C_D013256 against C_D003042 kindled-D_D012640 in mice.
abstract:Neuroactive C_D013256 demonstrate pharmacological actions that have relevance for a host of neurological and psychiatric disorders. They offer protection against D_D012640 in a range of models and seem to inhibit certain stages of D_D019966 in preclinical assessments. The present study was designed to evaluate two endogenous and one synthetic neuroactive C_D013256 that positively modulate the C_D005680 (C_D005680(A)) receptor against the increase in sensitivity to the convulsant effects of C_D003042 engendered by repeated C_D003042 administration (D_D012640 kindling). C_D011280 (C_D011280), C_D011280 (C_D011280) and C_C105051 (a synthetic derivative of alloC_D011280 C_C105051) were tested for their ability to suppress the expression (anticonvulsant effect) and development (antiepileptogenic effect) of C_D003042-kindled D_D012640 in male, Swiss-Webster mice. Kindled D_D012640 were induced by daily administration of 60 mg/kg C_D003042 for 5 days. All of these positive C_D005680(A) modulators suppressed the expression of kindled D_D012640, whereas only alloC_D011280 and C_C105051 inhibited the development of kindling. C_D011280 and C_D011280, but not C_C105051, also reduced cumulative lethality associated with kindling. These findings demonstrate that some neuroactive C_D013256 attenuate convulsant and sensitizing properties of C_D003042 and add to a growing literature on their potential use in the modulation of effects of drugs of abuse.

title:Kidney function and morphology after short-term combination therapy with C_D016572, C_D016559 and C_D020123 in the rat.
abstract:BACKGROUND: C_D020123 (C_D020123) may supplement calcineurin inhibitors in clinical organ transplantation. These are D_D007674, but C_D020123 seems to act differently displaying only minor D_D007674 effects, although this question is still open. In a number of treatment protocols where C_D020123 was combined with a calcineurin inhibitor indications of a synergistic D_D007674 effect were described. The aim of this study was to examine further the renal function, including morphological analysis of the kidneys of male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with either C_D016572 (C_D016572), C_D016559 (C_D016559) or C_D020123 as monotherapies or in different combinations. METHODS: For a period of 2 weeks, C_D016572 15 mg/kg/day (given orally), C_D016559 3.0 mg/kg/day (given orally) or C_D020123 0.4 mg/kg/day (given intraperitoneally) was administered once a day as these doses have earlier been found to achieve a significant immunosuppressive effect in Sprague-Dawley rats. In the 'conscious catheterized rat' model, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured as the clearance of Cr(EDTA). The morphological analysis of the kidneys included a semi-quantitative scoring system analysing the degree of striped D_D005355, subcapsular D_D005355 and the number of basophilic tubules, plus an additional stereological analysis of the total grade of D_D005355 in the cortex stained with Sirius Red. RESULTS: C_D016572, C_D016559 and C_D020123 all significantly decreased the GFR. A further deterioration was seen when C_D016572 was combined with either C_D016559 or C_D020123, whereas the GFR remained unchanged in the group treated with C_D016559 plus C_D020123 when compared with treatment with any of the single substances. The morphological changes presented a similar pattern. The semi-quantitative scoring was significantly worst in the group treated with C_D016572 plus C_D020123 (P<0.001 compared with controls) and the analysis of the total grade of D_D005355 also showed the highest proportion in the same group and was significantly different from controls (P<0.02). The C_D016559 plus C_D020123 combination showed only a marginally higher degree of D_D005355 as compared with controls (P=0.05). CONCLUSION: This rat study demonstrated a synergistic D_D007674 effect of C_D016572 plus C_D020123, whereas C_D016559 plus C_D020123 was better tolerated.

title:Effect of C_C007789 treatment on collagenase-induced D_D002543 in rats.
abstract:Inflammatory cells are postulated to mediate some of the D_D001925 following D_D002544. D_D002543 is associated with more D_D007249 than D_D002544. We tested the sulfated polysaccharide C_C007789, which has been reported to reduce inflammatory D_D001925, in a rat model of D_D002543 induced by injection of bacterial collagenase into the caudate nucleus. Rats were treated with seven day intravenous infusion of C_C007789 (30 micrograms h-1) or vehicle. The D_D006406 was assessed in vivo by magnetic resonance imaging. Motor behavior, passive avoidance, and skilled forelimb function were tested repeatedly for six weeks. C_C007789-treated rats exhibited evidence of D_D020141 and D_D020141, had larger D_D006406s, and tended to have less D_D007249 in the vicinity of the D_D006406 after three days. They showed significantly more rapid improvement of motor function in the first week following D_D006470 and better memory retention in the passive avoidance test. Acute D_D001929 and eventual D_D009410 in the striatum adjacent to the D_D006406 did not differ between the two groups. Investigation of more specific anti-inflammatory agents and hemodiluting agents are warranted in D_D002543.

title:Hepatic reactions associated with C_D007654 in the United Kingdom.
abstract:C_D007654 was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1981. By November 1984 the Committee on Safety of Medicines had received 82 reports of possible D_D056486 associated with the drug, including five D_D003643. An analysis of the 75 cases that had been adequately followed up suggested that 16, including three D_D003643, were probably related to treatment with the drug. Of the remainder, 48 were possibly related to treatment, five were unlikely to be so, and six were unclassifiable. The mean age of patients in the 16 probable cases was 57.9, with D_D056486 being more common in women. The average duration of treatment before the onset of D_D007565 was 61 days. None of these well validated cases occurred within the first 10 days after treatment. The results of serum liver function tests suggested D_D056486 in 10 (63%); the rest showed a mixed pattern. In contrast, the results of histological examination of the liver often showed evidence of D_D002779. The characteristics of the 48 patients in the possible cases were similar. Allergic manifestations such as D_D005076 and D_D004802 were rare. D_D056486 was usually reversible when treatment was stopped, with the results of liver function tests returning to normal after an average of 3.1 months. In two of the three D_D003643 probably associated with C_D007654 treatment the drug had been continued after the onset of D_D007565 and other symptoms of D_D056486. Clinical and biochemical monitoring at regular intervals for evidence of D_D056486 is advised during long term treatment with C_D007654 to prevent possible serious D_D056486.

title:Combined effects of prolonged C_D000527-induced D_D007022 and D_D020141 on human hepatic function.
abstract:Combined effects of prolonged C_D000527 (C_D000527)-induced D_D007022 and D_D020141 on hepatic function were studied in 30 patients undergoing hip surgery. The patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups; those in group A (n = 10) were subjected to controlled D_D007022 alone, those in group B (n = 10) to D_D020141 alone and those in group C (n = 10) to both controlled D_D007022 and D_D020141. D_D020141 in groups B and C was produced by withdrawing approximately 1000 mL of blood and replacing it with the same amount of C_D003911 solution, and final haematocrit values were 21 or 22%. Controlled D_D007022 in groups A and C was induced with C_D000527 to maintain mean arterial blood pressure at 55 mmHg for 180 min. Measurements included arterial ketone body ratio (AKBR, C_C016635/C_D020155) and clinical hepatic function parameters. AKBR and biological hepatic function tests showed no change throughout the time course in groups A and B. In group C, AKBR showed a significant decrease at 120 min (-40%) and at 180 min (-49%) after the start of D_D007022 and at 60 min (-32%) after recovery of normotension, and SGOT, SGPT, LDH and total C_D001663 showed significant increases after operation. The results suggest that a prolonged combination of more than 120 min of C_D000527-induced D_D007022 and moderate D_D020141 would cause D_D008107.

title:C_D007980-induced D_D004409 in patients with D_D010300: filling the bench-to-bedside gap.
abstract:C_D007980 is the most effective drug for the treatment of D_D010300. However, the long-term use of this C_D004298 precursor is complicated by highly disabling fluctuations and D_D004409. Although preclinical and clinical findings suggest pulsatile stimulation of striatal postsynaptic receptors as a key mechanism underlying C_D007980-induced D_D004409, their pathogenesis is still unclear. In recent years, evidence from animal models of D_D010300 has provided important information to understand the effect of specific receptor and post-receptor molecular mechanisms underlying the development of D_D004409. Recent preclinical and clinical data from promising lines of research focus on the differential role of presynaptic versus postsynaptic mechanisms, C_D004298 receptor subtypes, ionotropic and metabotropic C_D018698 receptors, and non-C_D004298rgic neurotransmitter systems in the pathophysiology of C_D007980-induced D_D004409.

title:Prevention of D_D012640 and reorganization of hippocampal functions by transplantation of bone marrow cells in the acute phase of experimental D_D004827.
abstract:In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMCs) in a model of D_D004827 induced by C_D010862 in rats. BMCs obtained from green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic mice or rats were transplanted intravenously after induction of D_D013226 (D_D013226). Spontaneous recurrent D_D012640 (D_-1) were monitored using Racine's D_D012640 severity scale. All of the rats in the saline-treated D_D004827 control group developed D_-1, whereas none of the BMC-treated D_D004827 animals had D_D012640 in the short term (15 days after transplantation), regardless of the BMC source. Over the long-term chronic phase (120 days after transplantation), only 25% of BMC-treated D_D004827 animals had D_D012640, but with a lower frequency and duration compared to the D_D004827 control group. The density of hippocampal neurons in the brains of animals treated with BMCs was markedly preserved. At hippocampal Schaeffer collateral-CA1 synapses, long-term potentiation was preserved in BMC-transplanted rats compared to D_D004827 controls. The donor-derived GFP(+) cells were rarely found in the brains of transplanted D_D004827 rats. In conclusion, treatment with BMCs can prevent the development of chronic D_D012640, reduce D_D009410, and influence the reorganization of the hippocampal neuronal network.

title:Cardioprotective effect of C_C066201 on C_D007545-induced D_D009203 in rats.
abstract:The present study was designed to evaluate the cardioprotective potential of C_C066201 on C_D007545-induced D_D009203 in rats. Hemodynamic parameters and lead II electrocardiograph were monitored and recorded continuously. Cardiac marker enzymes and antioxidative parameters in serum and heart tissues were measured. Assay for mitochondrial respiratory function and histopathological examination of heart tissues were performed. C_D007545-treated rats showed significant increases in the levels of C_D019344 dehydrogenase, C_D001224 transaminase, C_D003401 kinase and C_D008315 and significant decreases in the activities of C_D013481 dismutase, catalase and C_D005978 peroxidase in serum and heart. These rats also showed declines in left ventricular systolic pressure, maximum and minimum rate of developed left ventricular pressure, and elevation of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and ST-segment. In addition, mitochondrial D_D012131 characterized by decreased respiratory control ratio and C_D000244/O was observed in C_D007545-treated rats. Administration of C_C066201 for a period of 8 days significantly attenuated C_D007545-induced D_D006331 and D_D009202 and improved mitochondrial respiratory function. The protective role of C_C066201 against C_D007545-induced D_D009202 was further confirmed by histopathological examination. The results of our study suggest that C_C066201 possessing antioxidant activity has a significant protective effect against C_D007545-induced D_D009203.

title:Acute effects of C_C108761 on hippocampal C_D000596 neurotransmitters in C_D010862-induced D_D012640 in rats.
abstract:The present study aimed to investigate the anticonvulsant activity as well as the effects on the level of hippocampal C_D000596 neurotransmitters (C_D018698, C_D001224, C_D005998 and C_D005680) of C_C108761 (C_C108761) in comparison to its parent compound, C_D014635 (C_D014635). C_C108761 was more potent than C_D014635, exhibiting the median effective dose (ED(50)) of 49 mg/kg in protecting rats against C_D010862-induced D_D012640 whereas the corresponding value for C_D014635 was 322 mg/kg. In vivo microdialysis demonstrated that an intraperitoneal administration of C_D010862 induced a pronounced increment of hippocampal C_D018698 and C_D001224 whereas no significant change was observed on the level of C_D005998 and C_D005680. Pretreatment with either C_C108761 (50 and 100 mg/kg) or C_D014635 (300 and 600 mg/kg) completely abolished C_D010862-evoked increases in extracellular C_D018698 and C_D001224. In addition, a statistically significant reduction was also observed on the level of C_D005680 and C_D005998 but less than a drastic reduction of C_D018698 and C_D001224 level. Based on the finding that C_C108761 and C_D014635 could protect the animals against C_D010862-induced D_D012640 it is suggested that the reduction of inhibitory C_D000596 neurotransmitters was comparatively minor and offset by a pronounced reduction of C_D018698 and C_D001224. Therefore, like C_D014635, the finding that C_C108761 could drastically reduce C_D010862-induced increases in C_D018698 and C_D001224 should account, at least partly, for its anticonvulsant activity observed in C_D010862-induced D_D012640 in experimental animals. Some other mechanism than those being reported herein should be further investigated.

title:Acute D_D056486 attack after exposure to C_C106791.
abstract:INTRODUCTION: Antibiotic-associated D_D056486 is rare. With widespread use of antimicrobial agents, however, D_D056486 occurs frequently, and among D_D064420, idiosyncratic reactions are the most serious. CASE SUMMARY: A 25-year-old male patient, with a height of 175 cm and weight of 72 kg presented to Marmara University Hospital Emergency Department, Istanbul, Turkey, with 5 days' history of D_D007565, malaise, D_D009325, and D_D014839. He had been prescribed C_C106791 400 mg/d PO to treat an D_D012141 7 days prior. Admission laboratory tests were as follows: C_D000409 aminotransferase, 67 U/L (reference range, 10-37 U/L); C_D001224 aminotransferase, 98 U/L (10-40 U/L); alkaline phosphatase, 513 U/L (0-270 U/L); gamma-glutamyltransferase, 32 U/L (7-49 U/L); amylase, 46 U/L (0-220 U/L); total C_D001663, 20.1 mg/dL (0.2-1.0 mg/dL); direct C_D001663, 14.8 mg/dL (0-0.3 mg/dL); and albumin, 4.7 mg/dL (3.5-5.4 mg/dL). No toxin, C_D000431, or other drugs were reported. The patient had suffered a previous episode of "acute D_D056486 of unknown origin," that occurred after C_C106791 usage. Both incidents occurred within a year. DISCUSSION: C_C106791 is the first of the ketolide antibacterials to receive US Food and Drug Administration approval for clinical use. It has been associated with infrequent and usually reversible severe D_D008107. Based on a score of 8 on the Naranjo D_D064420 probability scale, C_C106791 was the probable cause of acute D_D056486 in this patient, and pathological findings suggested drug-induced toxic D_D056486. Recurrence of D_D056486 attack might have been avoided if the initial incident had been communicated to the attending physician who prescribed C_C106791 the second time. CONCLUSION: Here we report a case of acute D_D056486 probably associated with the administration of C_C106791.

title:C_D013148-induced D_D051437 and D_D006947 in patients with D_D006333.
abstract:BACC_D011188GROUND: A previous randomized controlled trial evaluating the use of C_D013148 in D_D006333 patients reported a low risk of D_D006947 (2%) and D_D051437 (0%). Because treatments for D_D006333 have changed since the benefits of C_D013148 were reported, the prevalence of these complications may differ in current clinical practice. We therefore sought to determine the prevalence and clinical associations of D_D006947 and D_D051437 in D_D006333 patients treated with C_D013148. METHODS: We performed a case control study of D_D006333 patients treated with C_D013148 in our clinical practice. Cases were patients who developed D_D006947 (C_D011188(+) >5.0 mEq/L) or D_D051437 (C_D002857 >or=2.5 mg/dL), and they were compared to 2 randomly selected controls per case. Clinical characteristics, medications, and serum chemistries at baseline and follow-up time periods were compared. RESULTS: Sixty-seven of 926 patients (7.2%) required discontinuation of C_D013148 due to D_D006947 (n = 33) or D_D051437 (n = 34). Patients who developed D_D006947 were older and more likely to have D_D003920, had higher baseline serum C_D011188 levels and lower baseline C_D011188 supplement doses, and were more likely to be treated with beta-blockers than controls (n = 134). Patients who developed D_D051437 had lower baseline body weight and higher baseline serum C_D003404, required higher doses of loop diuretics, and were more likely to be treated with C_D049971 diuretics than controls. CONCLUSIONS: C_D013148-induced D_D006947 and D_D051437 are more common in our clinical experience than reported previously. This difference is explained by patient comorbidities and more frequent use of beta-blockers.

title:D_D007676 (D_D007676) after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTX) using calcineurin-based immunotherapy: risk of development and treatment.
abstract:BACKGROUND: The calcineurin inhibitors C_D016572 and C_D016559 are both known to be D_D007674. Their use in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTX) has dramatically improved success rates. Recently, however, we have had an increase of patients who are presenting after OLTX with D_D007676 (D_D007676). This retrospective study examines the incidence and treatment of D_D007676 and D_D007676 (D_D007676) in OLTX patients. METHODS: Patients receiving an OLTX only from June 1985 through December of 1994 who survived 6 months postoperatively were studied (n=834). Our prospectively collected database was the source of information. Patients were divided into three groups: Controls, no D_D007676 or D_D007676, n=748; D_D007676, sustained serum C_D003404 >2.5 mg/dl, n=41; and D_D007676, n=45. Groups were compared for preoperative laboratory variables, diagnosis, postoperative variables, survival, type of D_D007676 therapy, and survival from onset of D_D007676. RESULTS: At 13 years after OLTX, the incidence of severe D_D007674 was 18.1% (D_D007676 8.6% and D_D007676 9.5%). Compared with control patients, D_D007676 and D_D007676 patients had higher preoperative serum C_D003404 levels, a greater percentage of patients with D_D006530, higher percentage requirement for dialysis in the first 3 months postoperatively, and a higher 1-year serum C_D003404. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis using preoperative and postoperative variables identified that an increase of serum C_D003404 compared with average at 1 year, 3 months, and 4 weeks postoperatively were independent risk factors for the development of D_D007676 or D_D007676 with odds ratios of 2.6, 2.2, and 1.6, respectively. Overall survival from the time of OLTX was not significantly different among groups, but by year 13, the survival of the patients who had D_D007676 was only 28.2% compared with 54.6% in the control group. Patients developing D_D007676 had a 6-year survival after onset of D_D007676 of 27% for the patients receiving hemodialysis versus 71.4% for the patients developing D_D007676 who subsequently received kidney transplants. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who are more than 10 years post-OLTX have D_D007676 and D_D007676 at a high rate. The development of D_D007676 decreases survival, particularly in those patients treated with dialysis only. Patients who develop D_D007676 have a higher preoperative and 1-year serum C_D003404 and are more likely to have D_D006530. However, an increase of serum C_D003404 at various times postoperatively is more predictive of the development of D_D007676 or D_D007676. New strategies for long-term immunosuppression may be needed to decrease this complication.

title:Effect of intravenous C_D009553 on blood pressure and outcome after D_D020521.
abstract:BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Intravenous C_D009553 West European D_D020521 Trial (INWEST) found a correlation between C_D009553-induced D_D007022 (BP) and an unfavorable outcome in D_D020521. We sought to confirm this correlation with and without adjustment for prognostic variables and to investigate outcome in subgroups with increasing levels of D_D007022. METHODS: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of D_D002544 (within 24 hours) were consecutively allocated to receive placebo (n=100), 1 mg/h (low-dose) C_D009553 (n=101), or 2 mg/h (high-dose) C_D009553 (n=94). The correlation between average BP change during the first 2 days and the outcome at day 21 was analyzed. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-five patients were included in this analysis (n=92, 93, and 80 for placebo, low dose, and high dose, respectively). C_D009553 treatment resulted in a statistically significant D_D007022 (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) from baseline compared with placebo during the first few days. In multivariate analysis, a significant correlation between DD_D007022 and worsening of the neurological score was found for the high-dose group (beta=0.49, P=0. 048). Patients with a DD_D007022 of > or =20% in the high-dose group had a significantly increased adjusted OR for the compound outcome variable D_D003643 or dependency (Barthel Index <60) (n/N=25/26, OR 10. 16, 95% CI 1.02 to 101.74) and D_D003643 alone (n/N=9/26, OR 4.336, 95% CI 1.131 16.619) compared with all placebo patients (n/N=62/92 and 14/92, respectively). There was no correlation between SBP change and outcome. CONCLUSIONS: DBP, but not SBP, reduction was associated with neurological worsening after the intravenous administration of high-dose C_D009553 after D_D020521. For low-dose C_D009553, the results were not conclusive. These results do not confirm or exclude a neuroprotective property of C_D009553.

title:D_D009422 after spinal anesthesia: a lower incidence with C_D011318 and C_D002045 than with C_D008012.
abstract:BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that D_D009422 (D_D009422) frequently follow C_D008012 spinal anesthesia but are infrequent with C_D002045. However, identification of a short-acting local anesthetic to substitute for C_D008012 for brief surgical procedures remains an important goal. C_D011318 is an amide local anesthetic with a duration of action similar to that of C_D008012. Accordingly, the present, prospective double-blind study compares C_D011318 with C_D008012 and C_D002045 with respect to duration of action and relative risk of D_D009422. METHODS: Ninety patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II who were scheduled for short gynecologic procedures under spinal anesthesia were randomly allocated to receive 2.5 ml 2% C_D008012 in 7.5% C_D005947, 2% C_D011318 in 7.5% C_D005947, or 0.5% C_D002045 in 7.5% C_D005947. All solutions were provided in blinded vials by the hospital pharmacy. Details of spinal puncture, extension and regression of spinal block, and the times to reach discharge criteria were noted. In the evening of postoperative day 1, patients were evaluated for D_D009422 by a physician unaware of the drug administered and the details of the anesthetic procedure. RESULTS: Nine of 30 patients receiving C_D008012 experienced D_D009422, 1 of 30 patients receiving C_D011318 (P = 0.03) had them, and none of 30 patients receiving C_D002045 had D_D009422. Times to ambulate and to void were similar after C_D008012 and C_D011318 (150 vs. 165 min and 238 vs. 253 min, respectively) but prolonged after C_D002045 (200 and 299 min, respectively; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: C_D011318 may be preferable to C_D008012 for short surgical procedures because it has a similar duration of action but a lower incidence of D_D009422.

title:The role of C_D009538 in smoking-related D_D002318.
abstract:C_D009538 activates the sympathetic nervous system and in this way could contribute to D_D002318. Animal studies and mechanistic studies indicate that C_D009538 could play a role in accelerating D_D050197, but evidence among humans is too inadequate to be definitive about such an effect. Almost certainly, C_D009538 via its hemodynamic effects contributes to acute cardiovascular events, although current evidence suggests that the effects of C_D009538 are much less important than are the prothrombotic effects of cigarette smoking or the effects of C_D002248. C_D009538 does not appear to enhance D_D013927 among humans. Clinical studies of pipe smokers and people using transdermal C_D009538 support the idea that toxins other than C_D009538 are the most important causes of acute cardiovascular events. Finally, the dose response for cardiovascular events of C_D009538 appears to be flat, suggesting that if C_D009538 is involved, adverse effects might be seen with relatively low-level cigarette exposures.

title:D_D012640 resulting from a C_C047426 D_D062787.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: To report a case of C_C047426 D_D062787. CASE SUMMARY: A 40-year-old woman with D_D003865 took an D_D062787 of C_C047426 in an apparent suicide attempt. After the ingestion of 26 C_C047426 50-mg tablets, the patient experienced a witnessed generalized D_D012640. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit, C_C047426 was discontinued, and no further sequelae were seen. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of C_C047426 D_D062787 that resulted in a generalized D_D012640. Based on nonD_D062787 pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of C_C047426 and the potential risks of available interventions, no emergent therapy was instituted. CONCLUSIONS: The C_C047426 D_D062787 in our patient resulted in a single episode of generalized D_D012640 but elicited no further sequelae.

title:Effect of C_D009543 on renal function in liver transplant recipients receiving C_D016559.
abstract:The effect of C_D009543 on renal function in liver transplant recipients who were receiving C_D016559 was evaluated between January 1992 and January 1996. Two groups of patients receiving C_D016559 were compared over a period of 1 year, one group comprising D_D006973 patients who were receiving C_D009543, and the other comprising nonD_D006973 patients not receiving C_D009543. The time from transplant to baseline was similar in all patients. C_D009543 significantly improved kidney function as indicated by a significant lowering of serum C_D003404 levels at 6 and 12 months. The observed positive impact of C_D009543 on reducing the D_D007674 associated with C_D016559 in liver transplant recipients should be an important factor in selecting an agent to treat D_D006973 in this population.

abstract:The administration of intermittent intravenous infusions of C_D002927 is infrequently associated with the development of D_D001919. A 40-year-old man with D_D007938 and no history of D_D006331 developed recurrent, brief episodes of apparent D_D054138 while receiving continuous-infusion C_D002927 50 mg/hour. The D_D001145 were temporally related to C_D002927 administration, disappeared after dechallenge, and did not recur during C_D011899 treatment. This is the first reported case of D_D054138 associated with continuous-infusion C_D002927.

title:Composition of D_D042882 associated with C_D015282: response to oral C_D014580.
abstract:C_D015282, an effective treatment for D_D000172, induces D_D042882 in 13-60% of patients. Because knowledge of stone composition is essential for studies of their pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention, this was investigated by direct and indirect methods in 14 C_D015282 treated D_D000172 patients with D_D042882. Chemical analysis of D_D042882 retrieved at cholecystectomy from two patients, showed that they contained 71% and 87% C_D002784 by weight. In the remaining 12 patients, localised computed tomography of the gall bladder showed that eight had stones with maximum attenuation scores of < 100 Hounsfield units (values of < 100 HU predict C_D002784 rich, dissolvable stones). Gall bladder bile was obtained by ultrasound guided, fine needle puncture from six patients. All six patients had supersaturated bile (mean (SEM) C_D002784 saturation index of 1.19 (0.08) (range 1.01-1.53)) and all had abnormally rapid C_D002784 microcrystal nucleation times (< 4 days (range 1-4)), whilst in four, the bile contained C_D002784 microcrystals immediately after sampling. Of the 12 patients considered for oral C_D014580 (C_D014580) treatment, two had a blocked cystic duct and were not started on C_D014580 while one was lost to follow up. After one year of treatment, five of the remaining nine patients showed either partial (n = 3) or complete (n = 2) D_D042882 dissolution, suggesting that their stones were C_D002784 rich. This corresponds, by actuarial (life table) analysis, to a combined D_D042882 dissolution rate of 58.3 (15.9%). In conclusion, C_D015282 induced D_D042882 are generally small, multiple, and C_D002784 rich although, in common with spontaneous D_D042882 disease, at presentation some patients will have a blocked cystic duct and some D_D042882 containing C_D002118.

title:Neurologic effects of subarachnoid administration of C_C004616, C_D002045, and low pH normal saline in dogs.
abstract:The purpose of this study was to evaluate the neurologic consequences of deliberate subarachnoid injection of large volumes of C_C004616 in experimental animals. The possible role of low pH as well as total volume as potential factors in causing D_D020258 was evaluated. The 65 dogs in the study received injections in the subarachnoid space as follows: 6 to 8 ml of C_D002045 (N = 15), C_C004616 (N = 20), low pH normal saline (pH 3.0) (N = 20), or normal saline (N = 10). Of the 20 animals that received subarachnoid injection of C_C004616 seven (35%) developed hind-limb D_D010243. None of the animals that received C_D002045, normal saline, or normal saline titrated to a pH 3.0 developed hind-limb D_D010243. Of the 15 spinal cords of the animals that received C_C004616, 13 showed D_D013118; the nerve roots and subarachnoid vessels were normal. The spinal cords of the animals that received C_D002045, low pH normal saline (pH 3.0), or normal saline did not show abnormal findings.

title:Early adjuvant C_D004317 in superficial bladder carcinoma.
abstract:A multicenter study was performed in 110 patients with superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. C_D004317 (50 mg/50 ml) was administered intravesically within 24 h after transurethral resection of TA-T1 (O-A) D_D001749. Instillation was repeated twice during the first week, then weekly during the first month and afterwards monthly for 1 year. The tolerance was evaluated in these 110 patients, and 29 patients presented with local side-effects. In 24 of these patients chemical D_D003556 was severe enough for them to drop out of the study. No systemic side-effects were observed. Recurrence was studied in 82 evaluable patients after 1 year of follow-up and in 72 patients followed for 2-3 years (mean 32 months). Of the 82 patients studied after 1 year, 23 had primary and 59 recurrent disease. Of the 82 evaluable patients, 50 did not show any recurrence after 1 year (61%), while 32 presented with one or more recurrences (39%). Of these recurrences, 27 were T1 D_D009369 while five progressed to more highly invasive lesions. In patients that were free of recurrence during the first year, 80% remained D_D009369-free during the 2- to 3-year follow-up period. Of the patients developing one or more recurrences during the first year, only 50% presented with further recurrence once the instillations were stopped. The beneficial effect of C_D004317 appears obvious and might be related to the drug itself, the early and repeated instillations after TUR, or both.

title:D_D006947 associated with C_D013467 therapy.
abstract:D_D006947 has recently been recognized as a complication of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents (NSAID) such as C_D007213. Several recent studies have stressed the renal sparing features of C_D013467, owing to its lack of interference with renal C_D011464 synthesis. We describe 4 patients in whom D_D006947 ranging from 6.1 to 6.9 mEq/l developed within 3 to 8 days of C_D013467 administration. In all of them normal serum C_D011188 levels reached within 2 to 4 days of stopping C_D013467. As no other medications known to effect serum C_D011188 had been given concomitantly, this course of events is suggestive of a cause-and-effect relationship between C_D013467 and D_D006947. These observations indicate that initial hopes that C_D013467 may not be associated with the adverse renal effects of other NSAID are probably not justified.

title:D_D014693 during cesarean section after C_D012312 therapy: interaction with anesthetics.
abstract:This case illustrates that patients receiving C_D012312 for D_D007752 may risk interactions between the residual betamimetic effects of C_D012312 and the effects of anesthetics during cesarean section. Such interactions may result in serious D_D002318 even after cessation of an infusion of C_D012312. Preoperative assessment should focus on cardiovascular status and serum C_D011188 level. Delaying induction of anesthesia should be considered whenever possible. Careful fluid administration and cautious use of titrated doses of C_D004809 are advised. After delivery of the infant, there should be no contraindication to the use of an alpha-adrenergic vasopressor such as C_D010656 to treat D_D007022 patients with D_D013610.

title:Immunohistochemical, electron microscopic and morphometric studies of C_D004967-induced rat D_D015175 after C_D001971 treatment.
abstract:To clarify the effects of C_D001971 on D_D015175 cells in vivo, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural and morphometrical analyses were applied to C_D004967-induced rat D_D015175 cells 1 h and 6 h after injection of C_D001971 (3 mg/kg of body weight). One h after treatment, serum prolactin levels decreased markedly. Electron microscopy disclosed many secretory granules, slightly distorted rough endoplasmic reticulum, and partially dilated Golgi cisternae in the D_D015175 cells. Morphometric analysis revealed that the volume density of secretory granules increased, while the volume density of cytoplasmic microtubules decreased. These findings suggest that lowered serum prolactin levels in the early phase of C_D001971 treatment may result from an impaired secretion of prolactin due to decreasing numbers of cytoplasmic microtubules. At 6 h after injection, serum prolactin levels were still considerably lower than in controls. The D_D015175 cells at this time were well granulated, with vesiculated rough endoplasmic reticulum and markedly dilated Golgi cisternae. Electron microscopical immunohistochemistry revealed positive reaction products noted on the secretory granules, Golgi cisternae, and endoplasmic reticulum of the untreated rat D_D015175 cells. However, only secretory granules showed the positive reaction products for prolactin 6 h after C_D001971 treatment of the D_D000236 cells. An increase in the volume density of secretory granules and a decrease in the volume densities of rough endoplasmic reticulum and microtubules was determined by morphometric analysis, suggesting that C_D001971 inhibits protein synthesis as well as bringing about a disturbance of the prolactin secretion.

title:On two paradoxical side-effects of C_D011239 in rats, ribosomal RNA biosyntheses, and a mechanism of action.
abstract:D_D006529 and D_D009133 occurred in Wistar rats following the subcutaneous administration of C_D011239. In the liver both the content of RNA and the biosynthesis of ribosomal RNA increased while both the RNA content and ribosomal RNA biosynthesis were reduced in the gastrocnemius muscle. It is suggested that the drug acted in a selective and tissue-specific manner to enhance ribosomal RNA synthesis in the liver and depress such synthesis in the muscle. This view supports the contention that the liver and muscle are independent sites of C_D011239 action.

title:D_D012640 induced by the C_D003042 metabolite C_C005618 in rats.
abstract:The half-life (t1/2) of C_D003042 is relatively short, but some of the consequences of its use, such as D_D012640 and D_D020521, can occur hours after exposure. This led us to hypothesize that a metabolite of C_D003042 may be responsible for some of those delayed sequelae. We evaluated the potential of the major metabolite of C_D003042, C_C005618 (C_C005618), to cause D_D012640. Two separate equimolar doses (0.2 and 0.4 mumol) of either C_D003042 or C_C005618 were injected ventricularly in unanesthetized juvenile rats. Treated rats were then evaluated for incidence, latency, and D_D012640 pattern or for locomotor activity in animals without D_D012640. C_C005618-Induced D_D012640 occurred more frequently and had significantly longer latencies than those induced by equimolar amounts of C_D003042. Whereas C_D003042-induced D_D012640 were best characterized as brief, generalized, and tonic and resulted in D_D003643, those induced by C_C005618 were prolonged, often multiple and mixed in type, and rarely resulted in D_D003643. Electrical recordings from the hippocampus showed a rhythmic progression in EEG frequency and voltage with clinical D_D012640 expression. C_C005618-Injected rats that did not have D_D012640 had significantly more locomotor activity than C_D003042-injected animals without D_D012640. The finding that C_D003042- and C_C005618-induced D_D012640 differ in several respects suggests more than one mechanism for C_D003042-induced D_D012640 and emphasizes the importance of a C_D003042 metabolite, C_C005618.

title:Protection against C_D000661-induced D_D020258 toward striatal C_D004298 neurons in rodents by C_C070935, an excitatory C_D000596 antagonist.
abstract:C_C070935, C_C070935, has been described as a potent antagonist of the C_D016202 (C_D016202) subtype of C_D018698 receptor. Here its ability to antagonize the prolonged depletion of C_D004298 in the striatum by C_D000661 in C_D007488-treated rats is reported. A single 18.4 mg/kg (i.p.) dose of (+/-)-C_D000661 hemisulfate, given to rats pretreated with C_D007488, resulted in persistent depletion of C_D004298 in the striatum 1 week later. This prolonged depletion of C_D004298 in the striatum was antagonized by C_D016291 (C_D016291, a non-competitive antagonist of C_D016202 receptors) or by C_C070935 (a competitive antagonist of C_D016202 receptors). The protective effect of C_C070935 was dose-dependent, being maximum at 10-40 mgkg (i.p.). A 10 mg/kg dose of C_C070935 was effective in antagonizing the depletion of C_D004298 in the striatum, when given as long as 8 hr prior to C_D000661 but not when given 24 hr prior to C_D000661. Depletion of C_D004298 in the striatum was also antagonized when C_C070935 was given after the injection of C_D000661; C_C070935 protected when given up to 4 hr after but not when given 8 or 24 hr after C_D000661. The prolonged depletion of C_D004298 in the striatum in mice, given multiple injections of methC_D000661, was also antagonized dose-dependently and completely by C_C070935. The data strengthen the evidence that the D_D020258 effect of C_D000661 and related compounds toward nigrostriatal C_D004298 neurons involves C_D016202 receptors and that C_C070935 is an C_D016202 receptor antagonist with long-lasting in vivo effects in rats.

title:Reversal by C_D010656 of the beneficial effects of intravenous C_D005996 in patients with D_D009203.
abstract:C_D005996 has been shown to reduce ST-segment elevation during D_D009203, an effect potentiated in the dog by agents that reverse C_D005996-induced D_D007022. Our study was designed to determine the effects of combined C_D005996 and C_D010656 therapy. Ten patients with acute transmural D_D009203 received intravenous C_D005996, sufficient to reduce mean arterial pressure from 107 +/- 6 to 85 +/- 6 mm Hg (P less than 0.001), for 60 minutes. Left ventricular filling pressure decreased from 19 +/- 2 to 11 +/- 2 mm Hg (P less than 0.001). SigmaST, the sum of ST-segment elevations in 16 precordial leads, decreased (P less than 0.02) with intravenous C_D005996. Subsequent addition of C_D010656 infusion, sufficient to re-elevate mean arterial pressure to 106 +/- 4 mm Hg (P less than 0.001) for 30 minutes, increased left ventricular filling pressure to 17 +/- 2 mm Hg (P less than 0.05) and also significantly increased sigmaST (P less than 0.05). Our results suggest that addition of C_D010656 to C_D005996 is not beneficial in the treatment of patients with D_D009203.

title:Elevation of ADAM10, ADAM17, MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression with media degeneration features C_D002122-induced D_D017545 in a rat model.
abstract:PURPOSE: This study was designed to establish a rat model of D_D017545 (D_D017545) by C_D002122 (C_D002122)-induced D_D014652 and to explore the potential role of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their endogenous inhibitors (TIMPs) in D_D017545 formation. METHODS: Thoracic aorta of male Sprague-Dawley rats was exposed to 0.5M C_D002122 or normal saline (C_D012965). After 12weeks, animals were euthanized, and C_D002122-treated, C_D002122-untreated (n=12) and C_D012965-treated aortic segments (n=12) were collected for histological and molecular assessments. MMP-TIMP and ADAM mRNAs were semi-quantitatively analyzed and protein expressions were determined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Despite similar external diameters among C_D002122-treated, non-C_D002122-treated and C_D012965-treated segments, aneurymal alteration (n=6, 50%), media degeneration with regional disruption, fragmentation of elastic fiber, and increased collagen deposition (n=12, 100%) were demonstrated in C_D002122-treated segments. MMP-2, MMP-9, ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 mRNA levels were increased in C_D002122-treated segments (all p<0.01), with trends of elevation in C_D002122-untreated segments, as compared with C_D012965-treated segments. Immunohistochemistry displayed significantly increased expressions of MMP-2, MMP-9, ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 (all p<0.01) in intima and media for C_D002122-treated segments. TIMP mRNA and tissue levels did not differ obviously among the three aortic segments. CONCLUSION: This study establishes a D_D017545 model by periarterial C_D002122 exposure in rats, and demonstrates a significant elevation of expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, ADAM10 and ADAM17 in the pathogenesis of vascular remodeling.

title:When drugs disappear from the patient: elimination of intravenous medication by hemodiafiltration.
abstract:Twenty-three hours after heart transplantation, life-threatening acute D_D006333 was diagnosed in a patient requiring continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF). Increasing doses of C_D002395, sedatives, and muscle relaxants administered through a central venous catheter were ineffective. However, a bolus of C_D004837 injected through an alternative catheter provoked a D_D006973 crisis. Thus, interference with the central venous infusion by the dialysis catheter was suspected. The catheters were changed, and hemodynamics stabilized at lower C_D002395 doses. When the effects of IV drugs are inadequate in patients receiving CVVHDF, interference with adjacent catheters resulting in elimination of the drug by CVVHDF should be suspected.

title:Long-term C_D018698 supplementation failed to protect against D_D010523 of C_D017239.
abstract:Toxic D_D010523 is still a significant limiting factor for chemotherapy with C_D017239 (C_D017239), although C_D018698 and its closely related C_D000596 C_D018698 were claimed to ameliorate C_D017239 D_D020258. This pilot trial aimed to evaluate the role of C_D018698 supplementation for preventing C_D017239-induced D_D010523 in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical and electro-diagnostic study. Forty-three D_D010051 patients were available for analysis following six cycles of the same C_D017239-containing regimen: 23 had been supplemented by C_D018698 all along the treatment period, at a daily dose of three times 500 mg (group G), and 20 had received a placebo (group P). Patients were evaluated by neurological examinations, questionnaires and sensory-motor nerve conduction studies. There was no significant difference in the frequency of signs or symptoms between the two groups although D_D020258 symptoms presented mostly with lower scores of severity in group G. However, this difference reached statistical significance only with regard to reported D_D010146 sensation (P = 0.011). Also the frequency of abnormal electro-diagnostic findings showed similarity between the two groups (G: 7/23 = 30.4%; P: 6/20 = 30%). This pilot study leads to the conclusion that C_D018698 supplementation at the chosen regimen fails to protect against D_D010523 of C_D017239.

title:Attentional modulation of perceived D_D010146 intensity in C_D002211-induced secondary D_D006930.
abstract:Perceived D_D010146 intensity is modulated by attention. However, it is not known that how D_D010146 intensity ratings are affected by attention in C_D002211-induced secondary D_D006930. Here we show that perceived D_D010146 intensity in secondary D_D006930 is decreased when attention is distracted away from the D_D010146ful pinprick stimulus with a visual task. Furthermore, it was found that the magnitude of attentional modulation in secondary D_D006930 is very similar to that of C_D002211-untreated, control condition. Our findings, showing no interaction between C_D002211 treatment and attentional modulation suggest that C_D002211-induced secondary D_D006930 and attention might affect mechanical D_D010146 through independent mechanisms.

title:C_D013739-dependent D_D006973 and upregulation of intrarenal C_D000809ogen in Dahl C_D017673-sensitive rats.
abstract:Blood pressure (BP) is more C_D017673 sensitive in men than in premenopausal women. In Dahl C_D017673-sensitive rats (DS), high-C_D017673 (HS) diet increases BP more in males than females. In contrast to the systemic renin-C_D000809 system, which is suppressed in response to HS in male DS, intrarenal C_D000809ogen expression is increased, and intrarenal levels of ANG II are not suppressed. In this study, the hypothesis was tested that there is a sexual dimorphism in HS-induced upregulation of intrarenal C_D000809ogen mediated by C_D013739 that also causes increases in BP and D_D007674. On a low-C_D017673 (LS) diet, male DS had higher levels of intrarenal C_D000809ogen mRNA than females. HS diet for 4 wk increased renal cortical C_D000809ogen mRNA and protein only in male DS, which was prevented by castration. Ovariectomy of female DS had no effect on intrarenal C_D000809ogen expression on either diet. Radiotelemetric BP was similar between males and castrated rats on LS diet. HS diet for 4 wk caused a progressive increase in BP, protein and albumin excretion, and D_D007674 in male DS rats, which were attenuated by castration. C_D013739 replacement in castrated DS rats increased BP, D_D007674, and upregulation of renal C_D000809ogen associated with HS diet. C_D013739 contributes to the development of D_D006973 and D_D007674 in male DS rats on HS diet possibly through upregulation of the intrarenal renin-C_D000809 system.

title:Prenatal protein deprivation alters C_D004298-mediated behaviors and C_D004298rgic and glutamatergic receptor binding.
abstract:Epidemiological evidence indicates that prenatal nutritional deprivation may increase the risk of D_D012559. The goal of these studies was to use an animal model to examine the effects of prenatal protein deprivation on behaviors and receptor binding with relevance to D_D012559. We report that prenatally protein deprived (PD) female rats showed an increased stereotypic response to C_D001058 and an increased locomotor response to C_D000661 in adulthood. These differences were not observed during puberty. No changes in C_D006220-induced D_D002375 or C_D016291-induced locomotion were seen following PD. In addition, PD female rats showed increased (3)C_D006859-C_D016291 binding in the striatum and hippocampus, but not in the cortex. PD female rats also showed increased (3)C_D006859-C_D006220 binding and decreased C_D004298 transporter binding in striatum. No statistically significant changes in behavior or receptor binding were found in PD males with the exception of increased (3)C_D006859-C_D016291 binding in cortex. This animal model may be useful to explore the mechanisms by which prenatal D_D044342 enhances risk for D_D012559 in humans and may also have implications for developmental processes leading to differential sensitivity to drugs of abuse.

title:mToR inhibitors-induced D_D011507: mechanisms, significance, and management.
abstract:Massive urinary protein excretion has been observed after conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to mammalian target of C_D020123 (mToR) inhibitors, especially C_D020123, in renal transplant recipients with D_D051436. Because D_D011507 is a major predictive factor of poor transplantation outcome, many studies focused on this adverse event during the past years. Whether D_D011507 was due to C_D020123 or only a consequence of calcineurin inhibitors withdrawal remained unsolved until high range D_D011507 has been observed during C_D020123 therapy in islet transplantation and in patients who received C_D020123 de novo. Podocyte injury and focal segmental D_D005921 have been related to mToR inhibition in some patients, but the pathways underlying these lesions remain hypothetic. We discuss herein the possible mechanisms and the significance of mToR blockade-induced D_D011507.

title:Hypothalamic prolactin receptor messenger C_D012313 levels, prolactin signaling, and D_D006966 inhibition of pulsatile luteinizing hormone secretion are dependent on C_D004958.
abstract:D_D006966 can reduce fertility and libido. Although central prolactin actions are thought to contribute to this, the mechanisms are poorly understood. We first tested whether chronic D_D006966 inhibited two neuroendocrine parameters necessary for female fertility: pulsatile LH secretion and the C_D004967-induced LH surge. Chronic D_D006966 induced by the C_D004298 antagonist C_D013469 caused a 40% reduction LH pulse frequency in ovariectomized rats, but only in the presence of chronic low levels of C_D004958. C_D013469 did not affect the magnitude of a C_D013256-induced LH surge or the percentage of GnRH neurons activated during the surge. C_D004958 is known to influence expression of the long form of prolactin receptors (PRL-R) and components of prolactin's signaling pathway. To test the hypothesis that C_D004967 increases PRL-R expression and sensitivity to prolactin, we next demonstrated that C_D004958 greatly augments prolactin-induced STAT5 activation. Lastly, we measured PRL-R and suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS-1 and -3 and CIS, which reflect the level of prolactin signaling) mRNAs in response to C_D013469 and C_D004958. C_D013469 induced only SOCS-1 in the medial preoptic area, where GnRH neurons are regulated, but in the arcuate nucleus and choroid plexus, PRL-R, SOCS-3, and CIS mRNA levels were also induced. C_D004958 enhanced these effects on SOCS-3 and CIS. Interestingly, C_D004958 also induced PRL-R, SOCS-3, and CIS mRNA levels independently. These data show that GnRH pulse frequency is inhibited by chronic D_D006966 in a C_D013256-dependent manner. They also provide evidence for C_D004958-dependent and brain region-specific regulation of PRL-R expression and signaling responses by prolactin.

title:Estrogen prevents C_D002788 accumulation in macrophages induced by the HIV protease inhibitor C_D019438.
abstract:Individuals with HIV can now live long lives with drug therapy that often includes protease inhibitors such as C_D019438. Many patients, however, develop negative long-term side effects such as D_D050197. We have previously demonstrated that C_D019438 treatment increases D_D050197 formation in male mice to a greater extent than in female mice. Furthermore, peripheral blood monocytes isolated from C_D019438-treated females had less C_D002788 accumulation. In the present study, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which female hormones influence C_D002784 metabolism in macrophages in response to the HIV protease inhibitor C_D019438. We have utilized the human monocyte cell line, THP-1 as a model to address this question. Briefly, cells were differentiated for 72 h with 100 nM PMA to obtain a macrophage-like phenotype in the presence or absence of 1 nM C_D004958 (C_D004958), 100 nM C_D011374 or vehicle (0.01% C_D000431). Cells were then treated with 30 ng/ml C_D019438 or vehicle in the presence of aggregated LDL for 24 h. Cell extracts were harvested, and lipid or total RNA was isolated. C_D004958 decreased the accumulation of C_D002788s in macrophages following C_D019438 treatment. C_D019438 increased the expression of the scavenger receptor, CD36 mRNA, responsible for the uptake of LDL. Additionally, C_D019438 treatment selectively increased the relative levels of PPARgamma mRNA, a transcription factor responsible for the regulation of CD36 mRNA expression. Treatment with C_D004958, however, failed to prevent these increases at the mRNA level. C_D004958 did, however, significantly suppress CD36 protein levels as measured by fluorescent immunocytochemistry. This data suggests that C_D004958 modifies the expression of CD36 at the level of protein expression in monocyte-derived macrophages resulting in reduced C_D002788 accumulation following C_D019438 treatment.

title:Upregulation of brain expression of P-glycoprotein in MRP2-deficient TR(-) rats resembles D_D012640-induced up-regulation of this drug efflux transporter in normal rats.
abstract:PURPOSE: The multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) is a drug efflux transporter that is expressed predominantly at the apical domain of hepatocytes but seems also to be expressed at the apical membrane of brain capillary endothelial cells that form the blood-brain barrier (BBB). MRP2 is absent in the transport-deficient (TR(-)) Wistar rat mutant, so that this rat strain was very helpful in defining substrates of MRP2 by comparing tissue concentrations or functional activities of compounds in MRP2-deficient rats with those in transport-competent Wistar rats. By using this strategy to study the involvement of MRP2 in brain access of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), we recently reported that C_D010672 is a substrate for MRP2 in the BBB. However, one drawback of such studies in genetically deficient rats is the fact that compensatory changes with upregulation of other transporters can occur. This prompted us to study the brain expression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a major drug efflux transporter in many tissues, including the BBB, in TR(-) rats compared with nonmutant (wild-type) Wistar rats. METHODS: The expression of MRP2 and Pgp in brain and liver sections of TR(-) rats and normal Wistar rats was determined with immunohistochemistry, by using a novel, highly selective monoclonal MRP2 antibody and the monoclonal Pgp antibody C219, respectively. RESULTS: Immunofluorescence staining with the MRP2 antibody was found to label a high number of microvessels throughout the brain in normal Wistar rats, whereas such labeling was absent in TR(-) rats. TR(-) rats exhibited a significant up-regulation of Pgp in brain capillary endothelial cells compared with wild-type controls. No such obvious upregulation of Pgp was observed in liver sections. A comparable overexpression of Pgp in the BBB was obtained after C_D010862-induced D_D012640s in wild-type Wistar rats. Experiments with systemic administration of the Pgp substrate C_D010634 and the selective Pgp inhibitor C_C402343 in TR(-) rats substantiated that Pgp is functional and compensates for the lack of MRP2 in the BBB. CONCLUSIONS: The data on TR(-) rats indicate that Pgp plays an important role in the compensation of MRP2 deficiency in the BBB. Because such a compensatory mechanism most likely occurs to reduce D_D001927 from cytotoxic compounds, the present data substantiate the concept that MRP2 performs a protective role in the BBB. Furthermore, our data suggest that TR(-) rats are an interesting tool to study consequences of overexpression of Pgp in the BBB on access of drugs in the brain, without the need of inducing D_D012640s or other Pgp-enhancing events for this purpose.

title:Use of chromosome substitution strains to identify D_D012640 susceptibility loci in mice.
abstract:D_D012640 susceptibility varies among inbred mouse strains. Chromosome substitution strains (CSS), in which a single chromosome from one inbred strain (donor) has been transferred onto a second strain (host) by repeated backcrossing, may be used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that contribute to D_D012640 susceptibility. QTLs for susceptibility to C_D010862-induced D_D012640s, a model of D_D004833, have not been reported, and CSS have not previously been used to localize D_D012640 susceptibility genes. We report QTLs identified using a B6 (host) x A/J (donor) CSS panel to localize genes involved in susceptibility to C_D010862-induced D_D012640s. Three hundred fifty-five adult male CSS mice, 58 B6, and 39 A/J were tested for susceptibility to C_D010862-induced D_D012640s. Highest stage reached and latency to each stage were recorded for all mice. B6 mice were resistant to D_D012640s and slower to reach stages compared to A/J mice. The CSS for Chromosomes 10 and 18 progressed to the most severe stages, diverging dramatically from the B6 phenotype. Latencies to stages were also significantly shorter for CSS10 and CSS18 mice. CSS mapping suggests D_D012640 susceptibility loci on mouse Chromosomes 10 and 18. This approach provides a framework for identifying potentially novel homologous candidate genes for human D_D004833.

title:Investigation of mitochondrial involvement in the experimental model of D_D004827 induced by C_D010862.
abstract:D_D028361 have been associated with several aspects of epileptogenesis, such as energy generation, control of cell D_D003643, neurotransmitter synthesis, and free radical (FR) production. Increased production of FRs may cause mtDNA damage leading to decreased activities of oxidative phosphorylation complexes containing mtDNA-encoded subunits. In this study, we investigated whether increased generation of FR during D_D013226 would be sufficient to provoke abnormalities in mtDNA and in the expression and activity of cytochrome c oxidase (CCO), complex IV of the respiratory chain, in the chronic phase of the C_D010862 model of temporal lobe D_D004827. DNA analysis revealed low amounts of a 4.8 kb mtDNA deletion but with no differences in frequency or quantity in the control and experimental groups. We did not find abnormalities in the expression and distribution of an mtDNA-encoded subunit of CCO (CCO-I) or a relative decrease in CCO-I when compared with nuclear-encoded subunits (CCO-IV and SDH-fp). No abnormality in CCO activity was observed through histochemistry. Although evidences of D_D028361 were found in previously published studies, our results do not suggest that the FRs, generated during the acute phase, determined important abnormalities in mtDNA, in expression of CCO-I, and in CCO activity.

title:Causes of acute D_D057049 in patients receiving kidney transplantation.
abstract:OBJECTIVES: D_D057049 is a well-known problem in patients following renal transplantation. In postrenal transplantation, D_D057049 is often a reflection of D_D006463. We aimed to determine the causes of D_D057049 in a population of renal transplantation recipients and discuss the literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the causes of D_D057049 during a 1-year period, from June 2003 to June 2004, at the King Fahad National Guard Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, by reviewing the slides of all transplant biopsies (n=25) performed during this interval. Pre- and posttransplant crossmatching was done when possible. RESULTS: Five cases of D_D057049 were found. Three of these cases were from the 25 transplantations performed at King Fahad National Guard Hospital, while the other 2 transplantations had been performed abroad and were referred to us for follow-up. Three cases were related to C_D016572, and 1 case was secondary to both C_D016572 and C_D016559. The fifth case had features of D_D057049 related to an D_D016736 in a patient with D_D008180. CONCLUSIONS: In the literature, the most-frequent cause of D_D006463 in patients following renal transplantation is recurrence of the D_D006463. Other causes include drug-related (C_D016572, C_D016559) D_D064420, procoagulant status, and antibody-mediated rejection. We found that the most-frequent cause of D_D057049 was drug related, secondary mainly to C_D016572. In the current study, the frequency of D_D057049 was similar to the percentage reported in the literature (20%).

abstract:C_D002395-induced D_D009202 due to chronic excess of endogenous C_D002395 has been recognized for decades as a clinical phenomenon. In contrast, reports of D_D009202 due to acute iatrogenic D_D062787 are rare. A 35-year-old woman whose cervix uteri was inadvertently injected with 8 mg of C_D004837 developed D_D017682 that was characterized by severe hemodynamic compromise, profound, albeit transient, D_D018487, and only modestly elevated biochemical markers of D_D009202. Our case illustrates the serious consequences of medical errors that can be avoided through improved medication labeling and staff supervision.

title:D_D001749 in D_D014890: risks and relation to C_D003520.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: To assess and characterise the risk of D_D001749, and its relation to C_D003520, in patients with D_D014890. METHODS: In the population based, nationwide Swedish Inpatient Register a cohort of 1065 patients with D_D014890, 1969-95, was identified. Through linkage with the Swedish D_D009369 Register, all subjects in this cohort diagnosed with D_D001749 were identified. Nested within the cohort, a matched case-control study was performed to estimate the association between C_D003520 and D_D001749 using odds ratios (ORs) as relative risk. In the cohort the cumulative risk of D_D001749 after D_D014890, and the relative prevalence of a history of D_D001749 at the time of diagnosis of D_D014890, were also estimated. RESULTS: The median cumulative doses of C_D003520 among cases (n = 11) and controls (n = 25) were 113 g and 25 g, respectively. The risk of D_D001749 doubled for every 10 g increment in C_D003520 (OR = 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 4.9). Treatment duration longer than 1 year was associated with an eightfold increased risk (OR = 7.7, 95% CI 0.9 to 69). The absolute risk for D_D001749 in the cohort reached 10% 16 years after diagnosis of D_D014890, and a history of D_D001749 was (non-significantly) twice as common as expected at the time of diagnosis of D_D014890. CONCLUSION: The results indicate a dose-response relationship between C_D003520 and the risk of D_D001749, high cumulative risks in the entire cohort, and also the possibility of risk factors operating even before D_D014890.

title:C_D001120 transport in humans with C_D006854-induced D_D006973.
abstract:A deficient C_D001120-C_D009569 system is implicated in C_D006854-induced D_D006973. We investigate whether abnormalities in C_D001120 uptake contribute to this deficiency. Eight healthy men were recruited. C_C021650 (50 mg) was given orally every 6 hours for 24 hours after a 5-day fixed-salt diet (150 mmol/d). Crossover studies were performed 2 weeks apart. Thirty milliliters of blood was obtained for isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells after each treatment period. C_D001120 uptake was assessed in mononuclear cells incubated with C_D001120 (1 to 300 micromol/L), incorporating 100 nmol/L C_D001120 for a period of 5 minutes at 37 degrees C. Forearm [3H]-C_D001120 extraction was calculated after infusion of [3H]-C_D001120 into the brachial artery at a rate of 100 nCi/min for 80 minutes. Deep forearm venous samples were collected for determination of C_D001120 extraction. Plasma C_D006854 concentrations were significantly raised during the active phase (323+/-43 to 1082+/-245 mmol/L, P<0.05). Systolic blood pressure was elevated by an average of 7 mm Hg. Neither C_D001120 transport into mononuclear cells (placebo vs active, 26.3+/-3.6 vs 29.0+/-2.1 pmol/10 000 cells per 5 minutes, respectively, at an C_D001120 concentration of 300 micromol/L) nor C_D001120 extraction in the forearm (at 80 minutes, placebo vs active, 1 868 904+/-434 962 vs 2 013 910+/-770 619 disintegrations per minute) was affected by C_D006854 treatment; ie, that C_D001120 uptake is not affected by short-term C_D006854 treatment. We conclude that C_D006854-induced D_D006973 are not associated with abnormalities in the C_D001120 transport system.

title:MR imaging with quantitative diffusion mapping of C_D016559-induced D_D020258 in organ transplant patients.
abstract:Our objective was to investigate brain MR imaging findings and the utility of diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging in organ transplant patients who developed neurologic symptoms during C_D016559 therapy. Brain MR studies, including DW imaging, were prospectively performed in 14 organ transplant patients receiving C_D016559 who developed D_D009422. In each patient who had abnormalities on the initial MR study, a follow-up MR study was performed 1 month later. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values on the initial MR study were correlated with reversibility of the lesions. Of the 14 patients, 5 (35.7%) had D_D056784, 1 (7.1%) had D_D020146, and 8 (57.1%) had normal findings on initial MR images. Among the 5 patients with D_D056784, 4 patients (80.0%) showed higher than normal ADC values on initial MR images, and all showed complete resolution on follow-up images. The remaining 1 patient (20.0%) showed lower than normal ADC value and showed incomplete resolution with D_D001927. Diffusion-weighted imaging may be useful in predicting the outcomes of the lesions of C_D016559-induced D_D020258.

title:Sequential observations of D_D009436 and subsequent morphological changes by mouse exo utero development system: analysis of the mechanism of transformation from D_D009436 to D_D000757.
abstract:D_D000757 has been suggested to develop from D_D009436; however, there is little direct experimental evidence to support this, and the mechanism of transformation remains unclear. We examined this theory using the exo utero development system that allows direct and sequential observations of mid- to late-gestation mouse embryos. We observed the D_D009436 induced by C_D001374 at embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5), let the embryos develop exo utero until E18.5, and re-observed the same embryos at E18.5. We confirmed several cases of transformation from D_D009436 to D_D000757. However, in many cases, the D_D009436 brain tissue was preserved with more or less reduction during this period. To analyze the transformation patterns, we classified the D_D009436 by size and shape of the D_D009436 tissue into several types at E13.5 and E18.5. It was found that the transformation of D_D009436 tissue was not simply size-dependent, and all cases of D_D000757 at E18.5 resulted from embryos with a large amount of D_D009436 tissue at E13.5. Microscopic observation showed the configuration of D_D009436 at E13.5, frequent D_D006470 and detachment of the neural plate from surface ectoderm in the D_D009436 head at E15.5, and multiple modes of reduction in the D_D009436 tissue at E18.5. From observations of the vasculature, altered distribution patterns of vessels were identified in the D_D009436 head. These findings suggest that overgrowth of the D_D009436 neural tissue causes the altered distribution patterns of vessels, subsequent peripheral D_D012769 and/or D_D006470 in various parts of the D_D009436 head, leading to the multiple modes of tissue reduction during transformation from D_D009436 to D_D000757.

title:Acute C_D003042-induced D_D012640: differential sensitivity of six inbred mouse strains.
abstract:Mature male and female mice from six inbred stains were tested for susceptibility to behavioral D_D012640 induced by a single injection of C_D003042. C_D003042 was injected ip over a range of doses (50-100 mg/kg) and behavior was monitored for 20 minutes. D_D012640 end points included latency to forelimb or hindlimb clonus, latency to clonic running D_D012640 and latency to jumping bouncing D_D012640. A range of strain specific sensitivities was documented with A/J and SJL mice being most sensitive and C57BL/6J most resistant. DBA/2J, BALB/cByJ and NZW/LacJ strains exhibited intermediate sensitivity. EEG recordings were made in SJL, A/J and C57BL/6J mice revealing a close correspondence between electrical activity and behavior. Additionally, levels of C_D003042 determined in hippocampus and cortex were not different between sensitive and resistant strains. Additional studies of these murine strains may be useful for investigating genetic influences on C_D003042-induced D_D012640.

title:D_D000743 complicating C_D016559 (C_D016559) therapy.
abstract:We describe 3 episodes of D_D000743 (D_D000743) in 2 solid organ recipients under C_D016559 (C_D016559) therapy. In both cases, discontinuation of C_D016559 and treatment with plasma exchange, fresh frozen plasma replacement, C_D000305, C_D001241, and C_D004176 led to resolution of D_D000743. In one patient, reintroduction of C_D016559 led to rapid recurrence of D_D000743. C_D016559-associated D_D000743 is probably rare but physicians must be aware of this severe complication. In our experience and according to the literature, C_D016559 does not seem to cross-react with C_D016572 (C_D016572), an immuno-suppressive drug already known to induce D_D000743.

abstract:We report a case of variant D_D017180 induced by C_D003891 D_D064420. Unusual features of the D_D001145 are repetitive group beating, progressive shortening of the R-R interval, progressive widening of the QRS complex with eventual failure of intraventricular conduction, and changes in direction of the QRS axis. Recognition of variant D_D017180 is important because therapy differs from that of classic D_D017180.

title:C_D003891-induced D_D003693 at "subtherapeutic" concentrations: a case report.
abstract:An elderly patient treated with low dose C_D003891 developed a D_D003693 while her plasma level was in the "subtherapeutic" range. D_D003693, which may be induced by tricyclic drug therapy in the elderly, can be caused by tricyclics with low anticholinergic potency. Therapeutic ranges for C_D000928 that have been derived from general adult population studies may not be appropriate for the elderly. Further studies of specifically elderly patients are now required to establish safer and more appropriate guidelines for drug therapy.

title:Mouse strain-dependent effect of C_D000547 on motility and brain biogenic C_D000588.
abstract:The effect of C_D000547 hydrochloride, injected i.p. in 6 increments of 100 mg/kg each over 30 hr, on mouse motility and whole brain content of selected biogenic C_D000588 and major metabolites was studied in 4 strains of mice. These were the albino Sprague-Dawley ICR and BALB/C, the black C57BL/6 and the brown CDF-I mouse strains. C_D000547 treatment produced a biphasic effect on mouse motility. The initial dose of C_D000547 D_D003866 locomotor activity in all mouse strains studied with the BALB/C mice being the most sensitive. Subsequent C_D000547 treatments produced enhancement of motility from corresponding control in all mouse strains with the BALB/C mice being the least sensitive. The locomotor activity was decreased from corresponding controls in all strains studied, except for the ICR mice, during an overnight drug-free period following the fourth C_D000547 treatment. Readministration of C_D000547, after a drug-free overnight period, increased motility from respective saline control in all strains with exception of the BALB/C mice where D_D011596 occurred. Treatment with C_D000547 did not alter whole brain C_D004298 levels but decreased the amounts of C_D015102 in the BALB/C mice compared to saline control. Conversely, brain C_D009647 concentration was increased from saline control by C_D000547 in the BALB/C mice. The results suggest a strain-dependent effect of C_D000547 on motility and indicate a differential response to the acute and multiple dose regimens used. The BALB/C mouse was the most sensitive strain and could serve as the strain of choice for evaluating the side effects of C_D000547. The biochemical results of brain biogenic C_D000588 of BALB/C mouse strain suggest a probable decrease of C_D002395 turnover rate and/or metabolism by monoamine oxidase and a resulting increase in O-methylation of C_D009638 which may account for a D_D011596 caused by C_D000547 in the BALB/C mice.

title:No enhancement by C_D010634 of the hepatocarcinogenicity of a C_D002794-devoid diet in the rat.
abstract:An experiment was performed to test whether inclusion of C_D010634 in a C_D002794-devoid diet would increase the hepatocarcinogenicity of the diet. Groups of 5-week old male Fischer-344 rats were fed for 7-25 months semipurified C_D002794-devoid or C_D002794-supplemented diets, containing or not 0.06% C_D010634. No hepatic preneoplastic nodules or D_D006528 developed in rats fed the plain C_D002794-supplemented diet, while one preneoplastic nodule and one D_D006528 developed in two rats fed the same diet containing C_D010634. The incidence of preneoplastic nodules and of D_D006528 was 10% and 37%, respectively, in rats fed the plain C_D002794-devoid diet, and 17% and 30%, in rats fed the C_D010634-containing C_D002794-devoid diet. The results evinced no enhancement of the hepatocarcinogenicity of the C_D002794-devoid diet by C_D010634. Sporadic neoplastic lesions were observed in organs other than the liver of some of the animals, irrespective of the diet fed.

title:Effect of direct intracoronary administration of C_D008755 in patients with and without D_D000788.
abstract:The effects of intracoronary administration of C_D008755 were studied in 21 patients with D_D000788 and 22 patients with atypical D_D002637 and in others without D_D000787 (control group). C_D008755 was administered continuously at a rate of 10 micrograms/min up to 50 micrograms. In all patients with D_D000788, D_D003329 was provoked at a mean dose of 28 +/- 13 micrograms (mean +/- SD). In the control group neither ischemic ST change nor localized D_D013035 occurred. The basal tone of the right coronary artery was significantly lower than that of the left coronary artery. The percentage of vasoconstriction of the right coronary artery was significantly higher than that of the left coronary artery. These results suggest that D_D013035 provocation tests, which use an intracoronary injection of a relatively low dose of C_D008755, have a high sensitivity in D_D000788 and the vasoreactivity of the right coronary artery may be greater than that of the other coronary arteries.

title:C_D004280 stress echocardiography: a sensitive indicator of diminished myocardial function in asymptomatic C_D004317-treated long-term survivors of childhood D_D009369.
abstract:C_D004317 is an effective antiD_D009369 chemotherapeutic agent known to cause acute and chronic D_D009202. To develop a more sensitive echocardiographic screening test for D_D006331 due to C_D004317, a cohort study was performed using C_D004280 infusion to differentiate asymptomatic long-term survivors of childhood D_D009369 treated with C_D004317 from healthy control subjects. Echocardiographic data from the experimental group of 21 patients (mean age 16 +/- 5 years) treated from 1.6 to 14.3 years (median 5.3) before this study with 27 to 532 mg/m2 of C_D004317 (mean 196) were compared with echocardiographic data from 12 normal age-matched control subjects. Graded C_D004280 infusions of 0.5, 2.5, 5 and 10 micrograms/kg per min were administered. Echocardiographic Doppler studies were performed before infusion and after 15 min of infusion at each rate. C_D004280 infusion at 10 micrograms/kg per min was discontinued after six studies secondary to a 50% incidence rate of adverse symptoms. The most important findings were that compared with values in control subjects, end-systolic left ventricular posterior wall dimension and percent of left ventricular posterior wall thickening in C_D004317-treated patients were decreased at baseline study and these findings were more clearly delineated with C_D004280 stimulation. End-systolic left ventricular posterior wall dimension at baseline for the C_D004317-treated group was 11 +/- 1.9 mm versus 13.1 +/- 1.5 mm for control subjects (p less than 0.01). End-systolic left ventricular posterior wall dimension at the 5-micrograms/kg per min C_D004280 infusion for the C_D004317-treated group was 14.1 +/- 2.4 mm versus 19.3 +/- 2.6 mm for control subjects (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

title:Effects of C_D000628 on the threshold for initiating D_D014693 during D_D012131.
abstract:D_D001145 have frequently been reported in association with D_D012131. The possible additive role of pharmacologic agents in precipitating D_D006331 in patients with D_D012131 has only recently been emphasized. The effects of C_D000628 on the D_D014693 threshold during normal acid-base conditions and during D_D012131 were studied in anesthetized open chest dogs. The D_D014693 threshold was measured by passing a gated train of 12 constant current pulses through the ventricular myocardium during the vulnerable period of the cardiac cycle. During the infusion of C_D000628, the D_D014693 threshold was reduced by 30 to 40 percent of the control when pH and partial pressures of C_D010100 (C_C093415) and C_D002245 (C_D002245) were kept within normal limits. When D_D012131 was produced by D_D007040 (pH 7.05 to 7.25; PC02 70 to 100 mm Hg: P02 20 to 40 mm Hg), infusion of C_D000628 resulted in an even greater decrease in D_D014693 threshold to 60 percent of the control level. These experiments suggest that although many factors may contribute to the increased incidence of D_D001145 in D_D012131, pharmacologic agents, particularly C_D000628, may play a significant role.

title:Case report: acute unintentional C_D002217 intoxication.
abstract:INTRODUCTION: Intoxications with C_D002217, a muscarinic cholinergic receptor agonist are rare. We report an interesting case investigating a (near) fatal D_D011041. METHODS: The son of an 84-year-old male discovered a newspaper report stating clinical success with plant extracts in D_D000544. The mode of action was said to be comparable to that of the synthetic compound 'C_D002217'; that is, C_D002217. He bought 25 g of C_D002217 as pure substance in a pharmacy, and the father was administered 400 to 500 mg. C_D002217 concentrations in serum and urine on day 1 and 2 of hospital admission were analysed by HPLC-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Minutes after oral administration, the patient developed D_D009325, sweating and D_D007022, and finally collapsed. D_D001919, cholinergic symptoms and D_D006323 occurred. Initial cardiopulmonary resuscitation and immediate treatment with C_D004837 (C_D004837), C_D001285 and C_D005665 was successful. On hospital admission, blood pressure of the intubated, bradyarrhythmic patient was 100/65 mmHg. Further signs were D_D006945, D_D012798, D_-1, and severe D_D015877; the electrocardiographic finding was D_D006327. High doses of C_D001285 (up to 50 mg per 24 hours), C_D004837 and C_D004298 were necessary. The patient was extubated 1 week later. However, increased D_D004417 and D_D001986 necessitated reintubation. D_D012131 was further worsened by D_D011512 and severe bronchoconstriction. One week later, the patient was again extubated and 3 days later was transferred to a peripheral ward. On the next day he died, probably as a result of D_D006333. Serum samples from the first and second days contained 3.6 and 1.9 mg/l C_D002217, respectively. The corresponding urine concentrations amounted to 374 and 554 mg/l. CONCLUSION: This case started with a media report in a popular newspaper, initiated by published, peer-reviewed research on herbals, and involved human failure in a case history, medical examination and clinical treatment. For the first time, an analytical method for the determination of C_D002217 in plasma and urine has been developed. The analysed C_D002217 concentration exceeded the supposed serum level resulting from a therapeutic dose by a factor of 130 to 260. Especially in old patients, intensivists should consider intoxications (with cholinergics) as a cause of D_D002318.

title:Crossover comparison of efficacy and preference for C_C093622 10 mg versus C_D004878/C_D002110 in D_D008881.
abstract:C_C093622 is a selective C_D012701(1B/1D) receptor agonist with rapid oral absorption and early onset of action in the acute treatment of D_D008881. This randomized double- blind crossover outpatient study assessed the preference for 1 C_C093622 10 mg tablet to 2 C_D004878 1 mg/C_D002110 100 mg tablets in 439 patients treating a single D_D008881 attack with each therapy. Of patients expressing a preference (89.1%), more than twice as many preferred C_C093622 to C_D004878/C_D002110 (69.9 vs. 30.1%, p < or = 0.001). Faster relief of D_D006261 was the most important reason for preference, cited by 67.3% of patients preferring C_C093622 and 54.2% of patients who preferred C_D004878/C_D002110. The co-primary endpoint of being D_D010146 free at 2 h was also in favor of C_C093622. Forty-nine percent of patients were D_D010146 free 2 h after C_C093622, compared with 24.3% treated with C_D004878/C_D002110 (p < or = 0.001), C_C093622 being superior within 1 h of treatment. D_D006261 relief at 2 h was 75.9% for C_C093622 and 47.3% for C_D004878/C_D002110 (p < or = 0.001), with C_C093622 being superior to C_D004878/C_D002110 within 30 min of dosing. Almost 36% of patients taking C_C093622 were D_D010146 free at 2 h and had no recurrence or need for additional medication within 24 h, compared to 20% of patients on C_D004878/C_D002110 (p < or = 0.001). C_C093622 was also superior to C_D004878/C_D002110 in the proportions of patients with no D_D009325, D_D014839, D_D012001 or D_D020795 and for patients with normal function 2 h after drug intake (p < or = 0.001). More patients were (completely, very or somewhat) satisfied 2 h after treatment with C_C093622 (69.8%) than at 2 h after treatment with C_D004878/C_D002110 (38.6%, p < or = 0.001). Recurrence rates were 31.4% with C_C093622 and 15.3% with C_D004878/C_D002110. Both active treatments were well tolerated. The most common adverse events (incidence > or = 5% in one group) after C_C093622 and C_D004878/C_D002110, respectively, were D_D004244 (6.7 and 5.3%), D_D009325 (4.2 and 8.5%) and D_D006970 (5.5 and 2.3%).

title:D_D057049 and D_D051437 associated with antineoplastic chemotherapy.
abstract:Five patients with D_D002277 developed D_D057049 (characterized by D_D051437, D_D000743, and usually D_D013921) after treatment with C_D002945, C_D001761, and a C_D014748. One patient had D_D011697, three the D_D006463, and one an apparent forme fruste of one of these disorders. Histologic examination of the renal tissue showed evidence of D_D004211, primarily affecting the small arteries, arterioles, and glomeruli. Because each patient was D_D009369-free or had only a small D_D009369 at the onset of this syndrome, the D_D057049 may have been induced by chemotherapy. Diagnosis of this potentially fatal complication may be delayed or missed if renal tissue or the peripheral blood smear is not examined, because D_D051437 may be ascribed to C_D002945 D_D007674 and the D_D000740 and D_D013921 to drug-induced D_D001855.

title:Salvage therapy with C_C104457, C_D005047, and C_D003520 in relapsed/refractory paediatric T-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia and lymphoma.
abstract:A combination of 5 d of C_C104457 (C_C104457) with 5 d of C_D005047 (C_D005047) and C_D003520 (C_D003520) and prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy was used as salvage therapy in seven children with refractory or relapsed T-cell leukaemia or lymphoma. The most common side effects attributable to the C_C104457 included Grade 2 and 3 sensory and motor D_D009422 and D_D059352. D_D006402 was greater for the combination than C_C104457 alone, although median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery was consistent with other salvage therapies. All patients had some response to the combined therapy and five of the seven went into complete remission after one or two courses of C_C104457/C_D005047/C_D003520. Our experience supports the safety of giving C_C104457 as salvage therapy in synchrony with C_D005047 and C_D003520, although D_D009422 must be closely monitored.

title:The 3-week C_D012460 syndrome strikes again.
abstract:A 34-year-old lady developed a constellation of D_D003872, D_D005334, D_D008206 and D_D056486, beginning on the 17th day of a course of oral C_D012460 for sero-negative D_D001172. Cervical and inguinal lymph node biopsies showed the features of severe necrotising D_D008199, associated with erythrophagocytosis and prominent eosinophilic infiltrates, without viral inclusion bodies, suggestive of an D_D064420.A week later, fulminant drug-induced D_D056486, associated with the presence of anti-nuclear autoantibodies (but not with other markers of D_D001327), and accompanied by D_D009102 and D_D018805, supervened. She subsequently died some 5 weeks after the commencement of her drug therapy.Post-mortem examination showed evidence of D_D047508, acute hypersensitivity D_D009205, focal acute tubulo-interstitial D_D009393 and extensive D_D001855, with no evidence of D_D009369. It is thought that the clinico-pathological features and chronology of this case bore the hallmarks of the so-called "3-week C_D012460 syndrome", a rare, but often fatal, immunoallergic reaction to C_D012460.

title:C_D016642 (C_D016642) D_D064420.
abstract:C_D016642 is a monocyclic C_D000928 structurally related to C_D000661. C_D016642, a sustained-release formulation of C_D016642, was recently released in Ireland, as a smoking cessation aid. In the initial 6 months since it's introduction, 12 D_D062787 cases have been reported to The National Poisons Information Centre. 8 patients developed symptoms of D_D064420. Common features included D_D013610, drowsiness, D_D006212 and D_D012640. Two patients developed severe D_D001145, including one patient who was resuscitated following a D_D006323. All patients recovered without sequelae. We report a case of a 31 year old female who required admission to the Intensive Care Unit for ventilation and full supportive therapy, following ingestion of 13.5g C_D016642. Recurrent D_D012640 were treated with C_D003975 and broad complex D_D013610 was successfully treated with C_D000241. C_D016642 caused significant neurological and cardiovascular D_D064420 in D_D062787. The potential toxic effects should be considered when prescribing it as a smoking cessation aid.

title:Survey of complications of C_D007208 angiography in Japan.
abstract:PURPOSE: We evaluated the safety of C_D007208 for use in fundus angiography. METHODS: We sent a questionnaire concerning complications of C_D007208 to 32 institutions in Japan, which were selected on the basis of the client list from the Topcon Company, which manufactures the C_D007208 fundus camera. RESULTS: Ophthalmologists at 15 institutions responded, reporting a total of 3,774 C_D007208 angiograms performed on 2,820 patients between June 1984 and September 1992. Before angiography, intradermal or intravenous C_D007208 testing, or both was performed at 13 of 15 institutions. For three patients, the decision was made not to proceed with angiography after positive preangiographic testing. The dosage of C_D007208 used for angiography varied from 25 to 75 mg, depending upon the institution. There were 13 cases of adverse reactions (0.34%), ten of which were mild reactions such as D_D009325, D_D005076, D_D014581, D_D011537, and urgency to defecate, and did not require treatment. Also recorded were one case of D_D010146 of the vein, which required treatment, and two cases of D_D007022. The two D_D007022 patients required treatment for D_D012769. CONCLUSIONS: A comparison of frequency of adverse reactions to C_D007208 with the previously reported frequency of such reactions to C_D019793 indicated that C_D007208 is a safe as C_D019793 for use in angiography.

title:C_D001920 receptors antagonists and C_D009569 synthase inhibitors in C_D014750 and C_D013311 induced D_D006930 in chemotherapy and D_D003929 rat model.
abstract:PURPOSE: The influence of an irreversible inhibitor of constitutive C_D009569 synthase (L-C_D009569Arg; 1.0 mg/kg ip), a relatively selective inhibitor of inducible C_D009569 synthase (L-NIL; 1.0 mg/kg ip) and a relatively specific inhibitor of neuronal C_D009569 synthase (7-NI; 0.1 mg/kg ip), on antihyperalgesic action of selective antagonists of B2 and B1 receptors: D-Arg-[Hyp3,Thi5,D-Tic7,Oic8] C_D001920 (C_C065679; 70 nmol/kg ip) or des Arg10 C_C065679 (70 nmol/kg ip) respectively, in model of diabetic (C_D013311-induced) and toxic (C_D014750-induced) neuropathy was investigated. METHODS: The changes in D_D010146 thresholds were determined using mechanical stimuli--the modification of the classic paw withdrawal test described by Randall-Selitto. RESULTS: The results of this paper confirm that inhibition of C_D001920 receptors and inducible C_D009569 synthase but not neuronal C_D009569 synthase activity reduces diabetic D_D006930. Pretreatment with L-C_D009569Arg and L-NIL but not 7-NI, significantly increases antihyperalgesic activity both C_C065679 and des Arg10 C_C065679. It was also shown that both products of inducible C_D009569 synthase and neuronal C_D009569 synthase activation as well as C_D001920 are involved in D_D006930 produced by C_D014750. Moreover, L-C_D009569Arg and 7-NI but not L-NIL intensify antihyperalgesic activity of C_C065679 or des-Arg10C_C065679 in D_D010523. CONCLUSIONS: Results of these studies suggest that B1 and B2 receptors are engaged in transmission of nociceptive stimuli in both diabetic and D_D010523. In C_D013311-induced D_D006930, inducible C_D009569 synthase participates in pronociceptive activity of C_D001920, whereas in C_D014750-induced D_D006930 C_D001920 seemed to activate neuronal C_D009569 synthase pathway. Therefore, concomitant administration of small doses of C_D001920 receptor antagonists and C_D009569 synthase inhibitors can be effective in alleviation of neuropathic D_D010146, even in hospital care.

title:D_D066126 observed in association with high-dose C_D003520-based chemotherapy for metastatic D_D001943.
abstract:INTRODUCTION: C_D003520 is an alkylating agent given frequently as a component of many conditioning regimens. In high doses, its nonhematological dose-limiting D_D064420 is D_D009202. STUDY DESIGN: We combined C_D017239, C_D008558 and high-dose C_D003520, C_D013852, and C_D016190 in a triple sequential high-dose regimen for patients with metastatic D_D001943. Analysis was performed on 61 women with chemotherapy-responsive metastatic D_D001943 receiving 96-h infusional C_D003520 as part of a triple sequential high-dose regimen to assess association between presence of peritransplant D_D006333 (D_D006333) and the following pretreatment characteristics: presence of electrocardiogram (EKG) abnormalities, age, D_D006973, prior cardiac history, smoking, D_D003920, prior use of C_D018943, and left-sided chest irradiation. RESULTS: Six of 61 women (10%) developed clinically reversible grade 3 D_D006333 following infusional C_D003520 with a median percent decline in ejection fraction of 31%. Incidence of transient C_D003520-related cardiac D_D064420 (10%) is comparable to previous recorded literature. Older age was significantly correlated with the D_D006333 development; with median ages for the entire group and for patients developing D_D006333 of 45 and 59, respectively. No association was found with other pretreatment characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: As a result of these findings, oncologists should carefully monitor fluid balance in older patients. Routine EKG monitoring during infusional C_D003520 did not predict D_D006333 development.

title:Inappropriate use of C_D002220 and C_D020888 in typical D_D004832.
abstract:C_D002220 and C_D020888 are contraindicated in typical D_D004832. Of 18 consecutive referrals of children with resistant typical absences only, eight were erroneously treated with C_D002220 either as monotherapy or as an add-on. C_D020888 was also used in the treatment of two children. Frequency of absences increased in four children treated with C_D002220 and two of these developed D_D009207, which resolved on withdrawal of C_D002220. Absences were aggravated in both cases where C_D020888 was added on to concurrent treatment. Optimal control of the absences was achieved with C_D014635, C_C047781, or C_D005013 alone or in combination.

title:D_D000743 associated with the use of C_D009853.
abstract:C_D009853 is the first drug designed to block the final step in the acid secretory process within the parietal cell. It has been shown to be extremely effective in the treatment of D_D010437, D_D005764, and the D_D015043. Although clinical experience with C_D009853 is still limited, many controlled studies have established the short-term safety of this drug. We report the first case of a serious short-term adverse reaction with the use of C_D009853: D_D000743. The patient developed weakness, D_D053609, and D_D004417 2 days after starting therapy with C_D009853. Two weeks after the initiation of therapy, her hematocrit had decreased from 44.1% to 20.4%, and she had a positive direct Coombs antiglobulin test and an elevated indirect C_D001663. After she discontinued the C_D009853, her hemoglobin and hematocrit gradually returned to normal. The mechanism by which C_D009853 caused the patient's D_D000743 is uncertain, but physicians should be alerted to this possible adverse effect.

title:The use and D_D064420 of C_D016049 (C_D016049) in D_D015658 individuals intolerant to C_D015215 (C_D015215)
abstract:One hundred and fifty-one patients intolerant to C_D015215 (C_D015215) received C_D016049 (C_D016049) to a maximum dose of 12.5 mg/kg/day. Patient response was assessed using changes in CD4+ lymphocyte subset count, HIV p24 antigen, weight, and quality of life. Seventy patients developed major D_D009894 whilst on therapy; this was the first D_D000163 diagnosis in 17. Only minor changes in CD4+ lymphocyte subset count were observed in D_D000163 patients, although a more significant rise occurred in those with earlier stages of disease. Of those positive for p24 antigen at the commencement of the study 67% showed a positive response, and this was most likely in those with CD4+ lymphocyte subset counts above 100 mm3. A positive weight response was seen in 16% of patients. Most patients showed improvement in individual parameters and global score of quality of life. Adverse reactions possibly attributable to C_D016049 were common. The most common side-effect was D_D003967, which resulted in cessation of therapy in 19 individuals. D_D010523 occurred in 12 patients and D_D010195 in six. Thirteen patients developed a raised serum amylase without D_D015746. Seven patients developed D_D018149 characteristic of D_D003920 but these were mild, did not require treatment and returned to normal on ceasing C_D016049.

title:Can angiogenesis be a target of treatment for C_D012254 associated D_D000743?
abstract:BACKGROUND/AIMS: Recently C_D012254 has been found to inhibit angiogenesis and a number of angiogenesis inhibitors such as C_C473478 and C_C471405 have been found to cause acute D_D006461. We aimed to investigate whether there is a relation between hemoglobin, haptoglobin and angiogenesis soluble markers which are modifiable and can help in developing strategies against D_D000740. METHODS: Fourteen patients D_D019698 were treated by C_C100416 and C_D012254. Serum hemoglobin, haptoglobin and angiogenesis markers of vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoetin-2 were investigated before and after therapy. RESULTS: We observed a significant decrease in haptoglobin levels at the end of the treatment period. Hemoglobin levels also decreased but insignificantly by treatment. In contrast with the literature, serum levels of angiogenesis factors did not change significantly by C_C417083 and C_D012254 therapy. We found no correlation of angiogenesis soluble markers with either hemoglobin or haptoglobin. CONCLUSION: This is the first study in the literature investigating a link between angiogenesis soluble markers and C_D012254 induced D_D000740 in patients with D_D019698 and we could not find any relation. Future research with larger number of patients is needed to find out modifiable factors that will improve the safety of C_D012254 therapy.

title:C_D003042 causes memory and learning impairments in rats: involvement of nuclear factor kappa B and oxidative stress, and prevention by C_C052342.
abstract:Different mechanisms have been suggested for C_D003042 D_D064420 including an increase in oxidative stress but the association between oxidative status in the brain and C_D003042 induced-behaviour is poorly understood. Nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) is a sensor of oxidative stress and participates in memory formation that could be involved in drug D_D064420 and addiction mechanisms. Therefore NFkappaB activity, oxidative stress, neuronal C_D009569 synthase (nNOS) activity, spatial learning and memory as well as the effect of C_C052342, a previously proposed therapy for C_D003042 addiction, were evaluated in an experimental model of C_D003042 administration in rats. NFkappaB activity was decreased in the frontal cortex of C_D003042 treated rats, as well as C_D005978 concentration and C_D005978 peroxidase activity in the hippocampus, whereas nNOS activity in the hippocampus was increased. Memory retrieval of experiences acquired prior to C_D003042 administration was impaired and negatively correlated with NFkappaB activity in the frontal cortex. In contrast, learning of new tasks was enhanced and correlated with the increase of nNOS activity and the decrease of C_D005978 peroxidase. These results provide evidence for a possible mechanistic role of oxidative and nitrosative stress and NFkappaB in the alterations induced by C_D003042. C_C052342 prevented all the alterations observed, showing novel neuroprotective properties.

title:Antinociceptive and antiD_D000647 properties of the presynaptic cholinergic amplifier C_C087567.
abstract:The antinociceptive effect of C_C087567 [(+/-)-C_C087567] (10-40 mg kg-1 s.c.; 30-60 mg kg-1 p.o.; 10-30 mg kg-1 i.v.; 10-30 micrograms/mouse i.c.v.) was examined in mice, rats and guinea pigs by use of the hot-plate, abdominal-constriction, tail-flick and paw-pressure tests. (+/-)-C_C087567 antinociception peaked 15 min after injection and then slowly diminished. The antinociception produced by (+/-)-C_C087567 was prevented by the unselective muscarinic antagonist C_D001285, the M1-selective antagonists C_D010890 and C_D004025 and the C_D000109 depletor C_D006426, but not by the opioid antagonist C_D009270, the C_D005680 antagonist C_C066430, the H3 agonist C_C069357, the D2 antagonist C_D019257, the C_D012701 antagonist C_C072790 hydrochloride, the C_D012701 antagonist C_C058895 hydrobromide and the polyamines depletor C_D012110. Based on these data, it can be postulated that (+/-)-C_C087567 exerted an antinociceptive effect mediated by a central potentiation of cholinergic transmission. (+/-)-C_C087567 (10-40 mg kg-1 i.p.) was able to prevent D_D000647 induced by C_D012601 (1 mg kg-1 i.p.) and C_D004025 (2 mg kg-1 i.p.) in the mouse passive-avoidance test. Affinity profiles of (+/-)-C_C087567 for muscarinic receptor subtypes, determined by functional studies (rabbit vas deferens for M1, guinea pig atrium for M2, guinea pig ileum for M3 and immature guinea pig uterus for putative M4), have shown an M4/M1 selectivity ratio of 10.2 that might be responsible for the antinociception and the anti-D_D000647 effect induced by (+/-)-C_C087567 through an increase in C_D000109 extracellular levels. In the antinociceptive and antiD_D000647 dose range, (+/-)-C_C087567 did not impair mouse performance evaluated by the rota-rod test and Animex apparatus.

abstract:We report a case of intractable hemorrhagic cystitis due to C_D003520 therapy for D_D014890. Conservative treatment, including bladder irrigation with physiological saline and instillation of C_D015237, failed to totally control D_D006470. We then used hyperbaric C_D010100 at an absolute pressure of 2 atm, 5 days a week for 8 consecutive weeks. The D_D006470 ceased completely by the end of treatment and the patient remained free of D_D006417 thereafter. No side effect was noted during the course of therapy. In future, this form of therapy can offer a safe alternative in the treatment of C_D003520-induced hemorrhagic cystitis.

The results have shown that the degradation product C_C004658 is not a significant factor in C_C010882 associated erosive D_D003556. A high percentage of C_D007612-C_D003091 and C_D011206 irrigations were associated with erosive D_D003556 and suggested a possible complication with human usage. C_C005253 irrigations appeared to have a lower incidence of erosive D_D003556 but further studies would have to be performed before it could be recommended for use in urological procedures.

title:Clinical experiences in an open and a double-blind trial.
abstract:A total of sixty patients were trated with C_C006820 first in open conditions (20 patients), then on a double blind basis (40 patients) with C_D006220 as the reference substance. The open study lasted for four weeks; the drug was administrated in the form of 1 mg tablets. The daily dose (initial dose: 1 mg; mean dose at the end of the trial: 4.47 mg) was always administered in one single dose. Nineteen patients finished the trial, and in 18 cases the therapeutic result was considered very good to good. These results were confirmed by statistical analysis. Nine patients exhibited mild to moderate D_D001480; no other side effects were observed. The results of detailed laboratory tests and evaluations of various quantitative and qualitative tolerability parameters were not indicative of toxic effects. In the double blind study with C_D006220, both substances were found to be highly effective in the treatment of D_D019967. Certain clues, including the onset of action, seem to be indicative of the superiority of C_C006820. No differences were observed with respect to side effects and general tolerability.

title:C_D003474 ameliorates D_D003072 and oxidative damage in C_D010634 and C_D002220 administered rats.
abstract:The antiepileptic drugs, C_D010634 and C_D002220 are well known to cause D_D003072 on chronic use. The increase in free radical generation has been implicated as one of the important mechanisms of D_D003072 by antiepileptic drugs. C_D003474 has shown antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuro-protective properties. Therefore, the present study was carried out to investigate the effect of chronic C_D003474 administration on C_D010634- and C_D002220-induced D_D003072 and oxidative stress in rats. Pharmacokinetic interactions of C_D003474 with C_D010634 and C_D002220 were also studied. Vehicle/drugs were administered daily for 21days to male Wistar rats. Passive avoidance paradigm and elevated plus maze test were used to assess cognitive function. At the end of study period, serum C_D010634 and C_D002220, whole brain C_D008315 and reduced C_D005978 levels were estimated. The administration of C_D010634 and C_D002220 for 21days caused a significant D_D003072 as well as an increased oxidative stress. Concomitant C_D003474 administration prevented the D_D003072 and decreased the increased oxidative stress induced by these antiepileptic drugs. C_D003474 co-administration did not cause any significant alteration in the serum concentrations of both C_D010634 as well as C_D002220. These results show that C_D003474 has beneficial effect in mitigating the D_D003072 and oxidative damage in rats treated with C_D010634 and C_D002220 without significantly altering their serum concentrations. The findings suggest that C_D003474 can be considered as a potential safe and effective adjuvant to C_D010634 and C_D002220 therapy in preventing D_D003072 associated with these drugs.

title:C_C020972 protects the piriform cortex in the C_D010862 D_D013226 model.
abstract:C_C020972 (C_C020972) has a dual mechanism of action as an antioxidant and an inhibitor of the transcription factor kappa-beta. Both, production of reactive C_D010100 species as well as activation of NF-kappaB have been implicated in severe D_D009410 in different sub-regions of the hippocampus as well as in the surrounding cortices. The effect of C_C020972 on D_D013226-associated cell loss in the hippocampus and piriform cortex was evaluated in the rat fractionated C_D010862 model. Treatment with 150 mg/kg C_C020972 before and following D_D013226 significantly increased the mortality rate to 100%. Administration of 50 mg/kg C_C020972 (low-dose) did not exert major effects on the development of a D_D013226 or the mortality rate. In vehicle-treated rats, D_D013226 caused pronounced D_D009410 in the piriform cortex comprising both pyramidal cells and interneurons. Low-dose C_C020972 treatment almost completely protected from lesions in the piriform cortex. A significant decrease in neuronal density of the hippocampal hilar formation was identified in vehicle- and C_C020972-treated rats following D_D013226. In conclusion, the NF-kappaB inhibitor and antioxidant C_C020972 protected the piriform cortex, whereas it did not affect hilar D_D009410. These data might indicate that the generation of reactive C_D010100 species and activation of NF-kappaB plays a more central role in D_D012640-associated D_D009410 in the temporal cortex as compared to the hippocampal hilus. However, future investigations are necessary to exactly analyze the biochemical mechanisms by which C_C020972 exerted its beneficial effects in the piriform cortex.

title:Safety profile of a C_D009538 lozenge compared with that of C_D009538 gum in adult smokers with underlying medical conditions: a 12-week, randomized, open-label study.
abstract:BACKGROUND: C_D009538 polacrilex lozenges deliver 25% to 27% more C_D009538 compared with equivalent doses of C_D009538 polacrilex gum. The increased C_D009538 exposure from the lozenge has raised questions about the relative safety of the lozenge and gum. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the safety profiles of the 4-mg C_D009538 lozenge and 4-mg C_D009538 gum in smokers with selected label-restricted diseases. METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized, open-label study in adult smokers with D_D006331, D_D006973 not controlled by medication, and/or D_D003920. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive the 4-mg C_D009538 lozenge or 4-mg C_D009538 gum. Safety assessments were made at baseline and at 2, 4, 6, and 12 weeks after the start of product use. RESULTS: Nine hundred one patients were randomized to treatment, 447 who received the lozenge and 454 who received the gum (safety population). The majority were women (52.7%). Patients' mean age was 53.9 years, their mean weight was 193.9 pounds, and they smoked a mean of 25.2 cigarettes per day at baseline. Five hundred fifty-three patients, 264 taking the lozenge and 289 taking the gum, used the study product for > or =4 days per week during the first 2 weeks (evaluable population). The C_D009538 lozenge and C_D009538 gum were equally well tolerated, despite increased C_D009538 exposure from the lozenge. The incidence of adverse events in the 2 groups was similar during the first 2 weeks of product use (evaluation population: 55.3% lozenge, 54.7% gum), as well as during the entire study (safety population: 63.8% and 58.6%, respectively). Stratification of patients by sex, age, extent of concurrent smoking, extent of product use, and severity of adverse events revealed no clinically significant differences between the lozenge and gum. The most common adverse events were D_D009325 (17.2% and 16.1%; 95% CI, -3.7 to 6.0), D_D006606 (10.7% and 6.6%; 95% CI, 0.5 to 7.8), and D_D006261 (8.7% and 9.9%; 95% Cl, -5.0 to 2.6). Serious adverse events were reported in 11 and 13 patients in the respective groups. Fewer than 6% of patients in either group were considered by the investigator to have a worsening of their overall disease condition during the study. The majority of patients (>60%) experienced no change in their disease status from baseline. CONCLUSION: The 4-mg C_D009538 lozenge and 4-mg C_D009538 gum had comparable safety profiles in these patients with label-restricted medical conditions.

title:Development of C_D007980-induced D_D004409 in D_D010300 monkeys may depend upon rate of symptom onset and/or duration of symptoms.
abstract:C_D007980-induced D_D004409 (D_D004409) present a major problem for the long-term management of D_D010300 (D_D010300) patients. Due to the interdependence of risk factors in clinical populations, it is difficult to independently examine factors that may influence the development of D_D004409. Using macaque monkeys with different types of C_D015632-induced D_D010302, the current study evaluated the degree to which rate of symptom progression, symptom severity, and response to and duration of C_D007980 therapy may be involved in the development of D_D004409. Monkeys with acute (short-term) C_D015632 exposure, rapid symptom onset and short symptom duration prior to initiation of C_D007980 therapy developed D_D004409 between 11 and 24 days of daily C_D007980 administration. In contrast, monkeys with long-term C_D015632 exposure, slow symptom progression and/or long symptom duration prior to initiation of C_D007980 therapy were more resistant to developing D_D004409 (e.g., D_D004409 developed no sooner than 146 days of chronic C_D007980 administration). All animals were similarly symptomatic at the start of C_D007980 treatment and had similar therapeutic responses to the drug. These data suggest distinct differences in the propensity to develop D_D004409 in monkeys with different rates of symptom progression or symptom durations prior to C_D007980 and demonstrate the value of these models for further studying the pathophysiology of D_D004409.

title:C_D011441-induced perinuclear-staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-positive D_D014657 in conjunction with D_D010493.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of C_D011441-induced D_D014657 manifesting with D_D010493. METHODS: We present the first case report of a woman with D_D006980 treated with C_D011441 in whom a syndrome of D_D010493, D_D005334, and D_D005921 developed. Serologic testing and immunologic studies were done, and a pericardial biopsy was performed. RESULTS: A 25-year-old woman with D_D006111 had a D_D005334 and evidence of D_D010493, which was confirmed by biopsy. Serologic evaluation revealed the presence of perinuclear-staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (pANCA) against myeloperoxidase (MPO). C_D011441 therapy was withdrawn, and she was treated with a 1-month course of C_D011241, which alleviated her symptoms. A literature review revealed no prior reports of D_D010493 in anti-MPO pANCA-positive D_D014657 associated with C_D011441 therapy. CONCLUSION: D_D010493 may be the initial manifestation of drug-induced D_D014657 attributable to C_D011441 therapy.

title:Two mouse lines selected for differential sensitivities to C_C036150-induced D_D012640 are also differentially sensitive to various pharmacological effects of other C_D005680(A) receptor ligands.
abstract:Two mouse lines were selectively bred according to their sensitivity (BS line) or resistance (BR line) to D_D012640 induced by a single i.p. injection of methyl C_C036150-3-carboxylate (C_C036150), an inverse agonist of the C_D005680(A) receptor C_D001569 site. Our aim was to characterize both lines' sensitivities to various physiological effects of other ligands of the C_D005680(A) receptor. We measured C_D003975-induced anxiolysis with the elevated plus-maze test, C_D003975-induced sedation by recording the vigilance states, and C_D010852- and C_D010433-induced D_D012640 after i.p. injections. Results presented here show that the differential sensitivities of BS and BR lines to C_C036150 can be extended to C_D003975, C_D010852, and C_D010433, suggesting a genetic selection of a general sensitivity and resistance to several ligands of the C_D005680(A) receptor.

title:Analgesic effect of intravenous C_D007649 in D_D009369 patients on C_D009020 therapy: a randomized, controlled, double-blind, crossover, double-dose study.
abstract:D_D010146 not responsive to C_D009020 is often problematic. Animal and clinical studies have suggested that C_D016202 (C_D016202) antagonists, such as C_D007649, may be effective in improving opioid analgesia in difficult D_D010146 syndromes, such as neuropathic D_D010146. A slow bolus of subhypnotic doses of C_D007649 (0.25 mg/kg or 0.50 mg/kg) was given to 10 D_D009369 patients whose D_D010146 was unrelieved by C_D009020 in a randomized, double-blind, crossover, double-dose study. D_D010146 intensity on a 0 to 10 numerical scale; D_D009325 and D_D014839, drowsiness, D_D003221, and D_D014987, using a scale from 0 to 3 (not at all, slight, a lot, awful); Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (0-30); and arterial pressure were recorded before administration of drugs (T0) and after 30 minutes (T30), 60 minutes (T60), 120 minutes (T120), and 180 minutes (T180). C_D007649, but not saline solution, significantly reduced the D_D010146 intensity in almost all the patients at both doses. This effect was more relevant in patients treated with higher doses. D_D006212 occurred in 4 patients, and an unpleasant sensation ("empty head") was also reported by 2 patients. These episodes reversed after the administration of C_D003975 1 mg intravenously. Significant increases in drowsiness were reported in patients treated with C_D007649 in both groups and were more marked with C_D007649 0.50 mg/kg. A significant difference in MMSE was observed at T30 in patients who received 0.50 mg/kg of C_D007649. C_D007649 can improve C_D009020 analgesia in difficult D_D010146 syndromes, such as neuropathic D_D010146. However, the occurrence of central adverse effects should be taken into account, especially when using higher doses. This observation should be tested in studies of prolonged C_D007649 administration.

title:Endocrine screening in 1,022 men with D_D007172: clinical significance and cost-effective strategy.
abstract:PURPOSE: We reviewed the results of serum C_D013739 and prolactin determination in 1,022 patients referred because of D_D007172 and compared the data with history, results of physical examination, other etiological investigations and effects of endocrine therapy to refine the rules of cost-effective endocrine screening and to pinpoint actual responsibility for hormonal abnormalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: C_D013739 and prolactin were determined by radioimmunoassay. Every patient was screened for C_D013739 and 451 were screened for prolactin on the basis of D_D020018, D_D006177 or C_D013739 less than 4 ng./ml. Determination was repeated in case of abnormal first results. Prolactin results were compared with those of a previous personal cohort of 1,340 patients with D_D007172 and systematic prolactin determination. Main clinical criteria tested regarding efficiency in hormone determination were D_D020018, small testes and D_D006177. Endocrine therapy consisted of C_D013739 heptylate or human chorionic gonadotropin for D_D007006 and C_D001971 for D_D006966. RESULTS: C_D013739 was less than 3 ng./ml. in 107 patients but normal in 40% at repeat determination. The prevalence of repeatedly low C_D013739 increased with age (4% before age 50 years and 9% 50 years or older). Two D_D010911 were discovered after C_D013739 determination. Most of the other low C_D013739 levels seemed to result from nonorganic D_D007027 because of normal serum luteinizing hormone and prolactin and to have only a small role in D_D007172 (definite improvement in only 16 of 44 [36%] after androgen therapy, normal morning or nocturnal erections in 30% and definite vasculogenic contributions in 42%). Determining C_D013739 only in cases of D_D020018 or abnormal physical examination would have missed 40% of the cases with low C_D013739, including 37% of those subsequently improved by androgen therapy. Prolactin exceeded 20 ng./ml. in 5 men and was normal in 2 at repeat determination. Only 1 D_D015175 was discovered. These data are lower than those we found during the last 2 decades (overall prolactin greater than 20 ng./ml. in 1.86% of 1,821 patients, D_D015175s in 7, 0.38%). C_D001971 was definitely effective in cases with prolactin greater than 35 ng./ml. (8 of 12 compared to only 9 of 22 cases with prolactin between 20 and 35 ng./ml.). C_D013739 was low in less than 50% of cases with prolactin greater than 35 ng./ml. CONCLUSIONS: Low prevalences and effects of low C_D013739 and high prolactin in D_D007172 cannot justify their routine determination. However, cost-effective screening strategies recommended so far missed 40 to 50% of cases improved with endocrine therapy and the D_D010911. We now advocate that before age 50 years C_D013739 be determined only in cases of D_D020018 and abnormal physical examination but that it be measured in all men older than 50 years. Prolactin should be determined only in cases of D_D020018, D_D006177 and/or C_D013739 less than 4 ng./ml.

title:C_D013874 pretreatment for C_D015742 injection D_D010146 in ambulatory patients.
abstract:This study investigated C_D015742 injection D_D010146 in patients undergoing ambulatory anaesthesia. In a randomized, double-blind trial, 90 women were allocated to receive one of three treatments prior to induction of anaesthesia with C_D015742. Patients in Group C received 2 ml normal saline, Group L, 2 ml, C_D008012 2% (40 mg) and Group T, 2 ml C_D013874 2.5% (50 mg). Venous discomfort was assessed with a visual analogue scale (VAS) 5-15 sec after commencing C_D015742 administration using an infusion pump (rate 1000 micrograms.kg-1.min-1). D_D014474 occurred in 60-90 sec. Visual analogue scores (mean +/- SD) during induction were lower in Groups L (3.3 +/- 2.5) and T (4.1 +/- 2.7) than in Group C (5.6 +/- 2.3); P = 0.0031. The incidence of venous discomfort was lower in Group L (76.6%; P < 0.05) than in Group C (100%) but not different from Group T (90%). The VAS scores for recall of D_D010146 in the recovery room were correlated with the VAS scores during induction (r = 0.7045; P < 0.0001). Recovery room discharge times were similar: C (75.9 +/- 19.4 min); L 73.6 +/- 21.6 min); T (77.1 +/- 18.9 min). Assessing their overall satisfaction, 89.7% would choose C_D015742 anaesthesia again. We conclude that C_D008012 reduces the incidence and severity of C_D015742 injection D_D010146 in ambulatory patients whereas C_D013874 only reduces its severity.

title:Comparison of i.v. C_D006024 and C_D001285 in the prevention of D_D001919 and D_D001145 following repeated doses of C_D013390 in children.
abstract:The effectiveness of administration of C_D006024 5 and 10 micrograms kg-1 and C_D001285 10 and 20 micrograms kg-1 i.v. immediately before the induction of anaesthesia, to prevent D_D001145 and D_D001919 following repeated doses of C_D013390 in children, was studied. A control group was included for comparison with the lower dose range of C_D006024 and C_D001285. A frequency of D_D001919 of 50% was noted in the control group, but this was not significantly different from the frequency with the active drugs. D_D001919 (defined as a decrease in heart rate to less than 50 beat min-1) was prevented when the larger dose of either active drug was used. It is recommended that either C_D006024 10 micrograms kg-1 or C_D001285 20 micrograms kg-1 i.v. should immediately precede induction of anaesthesia, in children, if the repeated administration of C_D013390 is anticipated.

title:Reduction in C_D002110 D_D064420 by C_D000082.
abstract:A patient who allegedly consumed 100 tablets of an over-the-counter analgesic containing C_-1, C_D002110, and C_D000082 displayed no significant CNS stimulation despite the presence of 175 micrograms of C_D002110 per mL of serum. Because salicylates have been reported to augment the stimulatory effects of C_D002110 on the CNS, attention was focused on the possibility that the presence of C_D000082 (52 micrograms/mL) reduced the CNS D_D064420 of C_D002110. Studies in DBA/2J mice showed that: 1) pretreatment with C_D000082 (100 mg/kg) increased the interval between the administration of C_D002110 (300 to 450 mg/kg IP) and the onset of fatal D_D012640 by a factor of about two; and 2) pretreatment with C_D000082 (75 mg/kg) reduced the incidence of audiogenic D_D012640 produced in the presence of C_D002110 (12.5 to 75 mg/kg IP). The frequency of sound-induced D_D012640 after 12.5 or 25 mg/kg C_D002110 was reduced from 50 to 5% by C_D000082. In the absence of C_D002110, C_D000082 (up to 300 mg/kg) did not modify the D_D012640 induced by maximal electroshock and did not alter the convulsant dose of C_D010433 in mice (tests performed by the Anticonvulsant Screening Project of NINCDS). C_D000082 (up to 150 micrograms/mL) did not retard the incorporation of radioactive C_D000241 into C_D000255 in slices of rat cerebral cortex. Thus the mechanism by which C_D000082 antagonizes the actions of C_D002110 in the CNS remains unknown.

title:C_C047847: an ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blocking agent.
abstract:C_C047847 (C_C047847) is a nonselective, competitive, ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blocking agent, without any intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. C_C047847 is metabolized by plasma esterases and has an elimination half-life of approximately 6.5 minutes. This agent was well tolerated in healthy volunteers at doses up to 100 micrograms/kg/min. In long-term infusion studies, C_C047847 was well tolerated at the effective beta-blocking dose (5 micrograms/kg/min) for up to seven days. C_C047847 blood concentrations increased linearly with increasing dose and good correlation exists between blood concentrations of C_C047847 and beta-adrenergic blockade. C_C047847 produced a dose-dependent attenuation of C_D007545-induced D_D013610. Electrophysiologic and hemodynamic effects of C_C047847 are similar to those of other beta blockers. In contrast with other beta blockers, C_C047847-induced effects reverse rapidly (within 30 minutes) following discontinuation because of its short half-life. C_C047847 effectively reduced heart rate in patients with D_D013617. In patients with D_D000789, C_C047847 infusion was found to be safe and effective in controlling D_D002637. It is concluded that C_C047847 is a potent, well-tolerated, ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blocking agent. Use of C_C047847 in the critical care setting is currently undergoing investigation.

title:Adverse effect of the C_D002118 channel blocker C_D009568 on D_D009400 in rats with D_D006978.
abstract:The effect of a 6-week treatment with the C_D002118 channel blocker C_D009568 or the C_D000809 converting enzyme inhibitor C_D004656 on blood pressure, D_D000419, renal hemodynamics, and morphology of the nonclipped kidney was studied in rats with two-kidney, one clip D_D006978. Six weeks after clipping of one renal artery, D_D006973 rats (178 +/- 4 mm Hg) were randomly assigned to three groups: untreated D_D006973 controls (n = 8), C_D004656-treated (n = 8), or C_D009568-treated (n = 10). Sham-operated rats served as normotensive controls (128 +/- 3 mm Hg, n = 8). After 6 weeks of treatment, renal hemodynamics (glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow) were measured in the anesthetized rats. Renal tissue was obtained for determination of glomerular size and sclerosis. C_D004656 but not C_D009568 reduced blood pressure significantly. After 6 weeks of therapy, glomerular filtration rate was not different among the studied groups. Renal plasma flow increased, but albumin excretion and D_D005921 did not change after C_D004656 treatment. In contrast, in the C_D009568-treated group D_D000419 increased from 12.8 +/- 2 progressively to 163 +/- 55 compared with 19.2 +/- 9 mg/24 hr in the D_D006973 controls. Furthermore, D_D005921 index was significantly increased in the C_D009568-treated group compared with the D_D006973 controls (0.38 +/- 0.1 versus 0.13 +/- 0.04). In addition, glomerular size was higher in the C_D009568-treated group (14.9 +/- 0.17 10(-3) mm2) but lower in the C_D004656-treated group (11.5 +/- 0.15 10(-3) mm2) compared with the D_D006973 controls (12.1 +/- 0.17 10(-3) mm2).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

title:Treatment of D_D014012 by intratympanic instillation of C_D008012 (C_D008012) 2 per cent through ventilation tubes.
abstract:Idiopathic subjective D_D014012 (D_D014012) is one of the most obscure otological pathologies. This paper presents the results of treating D_D014012 by intratympanic instillation of C_D008012 (C_D008012) 2 per cent through a grommet, for five weekly courses. Fifty-two patients suffering from intractable D_D014012 entered this therapeutic trial, but only nine finished all five courses. In one patient, the D_D014012 was almost completely abolished, but in all the nine patients the decompensated D_D014012 changed to a compensated one. We suggest this mode of treatment for patients that were previously treated by drugs, acupuncture and biofeedback, with disappointing results. Patients should be warned about the side effects of D_D014717 and D_D014839, which subsides gradually with every new instillation, and that the D_D014012 may not disappear but will be alleviated, enabling them to cope more easily with the disease and lead a more normal life.

title:C_C023470 and D_D010523.
abstract:D_D010523 has been noted as a complication of therapy with C_C023470, a drug widely used in France (and in clinical trials in the United States) for the prophylactic treatment of D_D000787. In 24 patients with this complication, the marked slowing of motor nerve conduction velocity and the electromyographic changes imply mainly a D_D003711. Improvement was noted with cessation of therapy. In a few cases the presence of active denervation signified a poor prognosis, with only slight improvement. The underlying mechanism causing the D_D009422 is not yet fully known, although some evidence indicates that it may be a lipid storage process.

title:Effect of humoral modulators of C_D009020-induced D_D006948 of mice.
abstract:The effect of humoral modulators on the C_D009020-induced D_D006948 of mice was studied. The subcutaneous administration of 10 mg/kg of C_D009020-HC1 produced a marked D_D006948 in mice. The C_D009020-induced D_D006948 was potentiated by C_D012601 and attenuated by C_D010830. In contrast, both methC_D012601 and C_D009388, which do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier, had no effect on the D_D006948 produced by C_D009020. Pretreatment of mice with C_D019805 (20 mg/kg i.p., one hour), an inhibitor of C_D014443 hydroxylase, significantly decreased the activity-increasing effects of C_D009020. On the other hand, pretreatment with C_D010134 (3 X 320 mg/kg i.p., 24 hr), a C_D012701 depletor, caused no significant change in the D_D006948. The study suggests that the activity-increasing effects of C_D009020 are mediated by the release of C_D002395 from adrenergic neurons in the brain. And the results are consistent with the hypothesis that C_D009020 acts by retarding the release of C_D000109 at some central cholinergic synapses. It is also suggested from collected evidence that the activity-increasing effects of C_D009020 in mice are mediated by mechanisms different from those which mediate the activity-increasing effects of C_D009020 in rats.

title:Mechanisms of C_D016559-induced D_D006973 in the rat.
abstract:-C_D016559 (C_D016559) is a powerful, widely used immunosuppressant. The clinical utility of C_D016559 is complicated by substantial D_D006973 and D_D007674. To clarify the mechanisms of C_D016559-induced D_D006973, we studied the chronic effects of C_D016559 on the synthesis of endothelin-1 (ET-1), the expression of mRNA of ET-1 and endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1), the endothelial C_D009569 synthase (eC_D009569S) activity, and the expression of mRNA of eC_D009569S and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) in rat blood vessels. In addition, the effect of the specific endothelin type A receptor antagonist C_C079574 on C_D016559-induced D_D006973 in rats was studied. C_D016559, 5 mg. kg-1. d-1 given for 4 weeks, elevated blood pressure from 102+/-13 to 152+/-15 mm Hg and increased the synthesis of ET-1 and the levels of ET-1 mRNA in the mesenteric artery (240% and 230%, respectively). Little change was observed in the expression of ECE-1 mRNA and CNP mRNA. C_D016559 decreased eC_D009569S activity and the levels of eC_D009569S mRNA in the aorta (48% and 55%, respectively). The administration of C_C079574 (10 mg. kg-1. d-1) prevented C_D016559-induced D_D006973 in rats. These results indicate that C_D016559 may increase blood pressure not only by increasing ET-1 production but also by decreasing C_D009569 synthesis in the vasculature.

abstract:C_D013390 causes prolonged D_D001049 in patients in whom pseudocholinesterase enzyme gets deactivated by C_D009943. Here, we present a similar incident in a severely D_D003866 patient who received electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Prolonged D_D001049 in our case ensued because the information about suicidal attempt by C_D009943 was concealed from the treating team.

title:The effects of the adjunctive C_D016642 on male D_D012735 induced by a C_D017367: a double-blind placebo-controlled and randomized study.
abstract:OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and efficacy of adjunctive C_D016642 sustained-release (SR) on male D_D012735 (D_D012735) induced by a C_D017367 (C_D017367), as D_D012735 is a common side-effect of C_D017367s and the most effective treatments have yet to be determined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The randomized sample consisted of 234 euthymic men who were receiving some type of C_D017367. The men were randomly assigned to C_D016642 SR (150 mg twice daily, 117) or placebo (twice daily, 117) for 12 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated using the Clinical Global Impression-Sexual Function (CGI-SF; the primary outcome measure), the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX), and D_D007172 Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction (EDITS) (secondary outcome measures). Participants were followed biweekly during study period. RESULTS: After 12 weeks of treatment, the mean (sd) scores for CGI-SF were significantly lower, i.e. better, in patients on C_D016642 SR, at 2.4 (1.2), than in the placebo group, at 3.9 (1.1) (P= 0.01). Men who received C_D016642 had a significant increase in the total IIEF score (54.4% vs 1.2%; P= 0.003), and in the five different domains of the IIEF. Total ASEX scores were significantly lower, i.e. better, among men who received C_D016642 than placebo, at 15.5 (4.3) vs 21.5 (4.7) (P= 0.002). The EDITS scores were 67.4 (10.2) for the C_D016642 and 36.3 (11.7) for the placebo group (P= 0.001). The ASEX score and CGI-SF score were correlated (P= 0.003). In linear regression analyses the CGI-SF score was not affected significantly by the duration of D_D012735, type of C_D017367 used and age. CONCLUSIONS: C_D016642 is an effective treatment for male D_D012735 induced by C_D017367s. These results provide empirical support for conducting a further study of C_D016642.

title:C_D019259 for the prevention of D_D006509 virus reactivation in C_D006514 (C_D006514) seropositive D_D009369 patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy.
abstract:D_D006509 virus (HBV) is one of the major causes of chronic D_D008107 worldwide. D_D009369 patients who are chronic carriers of HBV have a higher D_D008107 rate while receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy (CT) and this has mainly been attributed to HBV reactivation. In this study, D_D009369 patients who have solid and D_D019337 with chronic D_D006509 received the antiviral agent C_D019259 prior and during CT compared with historical control group who did not receive C_D019259. The objectives were to assess the efficacy of C_D019259 in reducing the incidence of HBV reactivation, and diminishing morbidity and mortality during CT. Two groups were compared in this study. The prophylactic C_D019259 group consisted of 37 patients who received prophylactic C_D019259 treatment. The historical controls consisted of 50 consecutive patients who underwent CT without prophylactic C_D019259. They were followed up during and for 8 weeks after CT. The outcomes were compared for both groups. Of our control group (n= 50), 21 patients (42%) were established D_D056486. Twelve (24%) of them were evaluated as severe D_D056486. In the prophylactic C_D019259 group severe D_D056486 were observed only in 1 patient (2.7%) of 37 patients (p < 0.006). Comparison of the mean ALT values revealed significantly higher mean C_D000409 aminotransferase (ALT) values in the control group than the prophylactic C_D019259 group; 154:64 (p < 0.32). Our study suggests that prophylactic C_D019259 significantly decreases the incidence of HBV reactivation and overall morbidity in D_D009369 patients during and after immunosuppressive therapy. Further studies are needed to determine the most appropriate C_D009705 or C_D009711 analogue for antiviral prophylaxis during CT and the optimal duration of administration after completion of CT.

title:C_C035054 restores the D_D007859 induced by chronic C_D009020 administration in rats.
abstract:C_C035054, as a C_D036145 extracted from Panax ginseng, could ameliorate spatial D_D007859. Previous studies have demonstrated that C_C035054 might be a useful agent for the prevention and treatment of the adverse effects of C_D009020. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of C_C035054 on D_D007859 by chronic C_D009020 administration and the mechanism responsible for this effect. Male rats were subcutaneously injected with C_D009020 (10 mg/kg) twice a day at 12 hour intervals for 10 days, and C_C035054 (30 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected 2 hours after the second injection of C_D009020 once a day for 10 days. Spatial learning capacity was assessed in the Morris water maze. The results showed that rats treated with C_D009020/C_C035054 decreased escape latency and increased the time spent in platform quadrant and entering frequency. By implantation of electrodes and electrophysiological recording in vivo, the results showed that C_C035054 restored the long-term potentiation (LTP) impaired by C_D009020 in both freely moving and anaesthetised rats. The electrophysiological recording in vitro showed that C_C035054 restored the LTP in slices from the rats treated with C_D009020, but not changed LTP in the slices from normal saline- or C_D009020/C_C035054-treated rats; this restoration could be inhibited by C_D016202 (C_D016202) receptor antagonist C_D016291. We conclude that C_C035054 may significantly improve the spatial learning capacity impaired by chonic C_D009020 administration and restore the C_D009020-inhibited LTP. This effect is C_D016202 receptor dependent.

title:A study on the effect of the duration of subcutaneous C_D006493 injection on D_D003288 and D_D010146.
abstract:AIM: This study was carried out to determine the effect of injection duration on D_D003288 and D_D010146 following the administration of the subcutaneous injection of C_D006493. BACKGROUND: Although different methods to prevent D_D003288 and D_D010146 following the subcutaneous injection of C_D006493 have been widely studied and described, the effect of injection duration on the occurrence of D_D003288 and D_D010146 is little documented. DESIGN: This study was designed as within-subject, quasi-experimental research. METHOD: The sample for the study consisted of 50 patients to whom subcutaneous C_D006493 was administered. C_D006493 was injected over 10 seconds on the right abdominal site and 30 seconds on the left abdominal site. Injections areas were assessed for the presence of D_D003288 at 48 and 72 hours after each injection. Dimensions of the D_D003288 on the C_D006493 applied areas were measured using transparent millimetric measuring paper. The visual analog scale (VAS) was used to measure D_D010146 intensity and a stop-watch was used to time the D_D010146 period. Data were analysed using chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon signed ranks tests and correlation. RESULTS: The percentage of D_D003288 occurrence was 64% with the injection of 10 seconds duration and 42% in the 30-second injection. It was determined that the size of the D_D003288 was smaller in the 30-second injection. D_D010146 intensity and D_D010146 period were statistically significantly lower for the 30-second injection than for the 10-second injection. CONCLUSIONS: It was determined that injection duration had an effect on D_D003288 and D_D010146 following the subcutaneous administration of C_D006493. This study should be repeated on a larger sample. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: When administering subcutaneous C_D006493 injections, it is important to extend the duration of the injection.

title:Acute C_D012110 and subchronic C_D006220 treatments change synaptosomal brain C_D018698 uptake and elicit D_D004409 in rats.
abstract:C_D012110- and C_D006220-induced D_D004409 are putative animal models of D_D004409 (D_D004409) whose pathophysiology has been related to free radical generation and oxidative stress. In the present study, the authors induced D_D004409 by acute C_D012110 and subchronic C_D006220 administration to rats. C_D012110 injection (one dose of 1 mg/kg s.c.) every other day for 3 days caused a significant increase in vacuous chewing, tongue protrusion and duration of facial twitching, compared to the control. C_D006220 administration (one dose of 12 mg/kg once a week s.c.) for 4 weeks caused an increase in vacuous chewing, tongue protrusion and duration of facial twitching observed in four weekly evaluations. After the treatments and behavioral observation, C_D018698 uptake by segments of the brain was analyzed. A decreased C_D018698 uptake was observed in the subcortical parts of animals treated with C_D012110 and C_D006220, compared to the control. Importantly, a decrease in C_D018698 uptake correlates negatively with an increase in the incidence of D_D004409. These results indicate that early changes in C_D018698 transport may be related to the development of vacuous chewing movements in rats.

title:D_D011605 due to treatment with C_D010672 in a nonD_D004827 patient.
abstract:The development of D_D011605 related to antiD_D004827 drug treatment is usually attributed to the interaction between the D_D004827 brain substratum and the antiD_D004827 drugs. The case of a nonD_D004827 patient who developed D_D011605 following C_D010672 treatment for D_D014277 is described. This case suggests that the D_D011605 that occur following C_D010672 treatment in some D_D004827 patients may be the direct result of medication, unrelated to D_D012640.

title:The effect of treatment with C_D006170 on C_D005839 D_D007674 in rats: a preliminary study.
abstract:In the present work we assessed the effect of treatment of rats with C_D006170 on D_D058186 induced by C_D005839 (C_D005839) D_D007674. Rats were treated with the vehicle (2 mL/kg of distilled water and 5% w/v cellulose, 10 days), C_D006170 (2 mL/kg of a 10% w/v aqueous suspension of C_D006170 powder, orally for 10 days), or C_D006170 concomitantly with C_D005839 (80mg/kg/day intramuscularly, during the last six days of the treatment period). D_D007674 was assessed by measuring the concentrations of C_D003404 and C_D014508 in the plasma and reduced C_D005978 (C_D005978) in the kidney cortex, and by light microscopic examination of kidney sections. The results indicated that concomitant treatment with C_D006170 and C_D005839 significantly increased C_D003404 and C_D014508 by about 183 and 239%, respectively (compared to 432 and 346%, respectively, in rats treated with cellulose and C_D005839), and decreased that of cortical C_D005978 by 21% (compared to 27% in the cellulose plus C_D005839 group) The C_D005839-induced proximal D_D007683 appeared to be slightly less severe in rats given C_D005839 together with C_D006170 than in those given C_D005839 and cellulose. It could be inferred that C_D006170 treatment has induced a modest amelioration of some of the histological and biochemical indices of C_D005839 D_D007674. Further work is warranted on the effect of the treatments on renal functional aspects in models of D_D007676, and on the mechanism(s) involved.

title:D_D006212 associated with C_C022189.
abstract:C_C022189 is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug used to treat various types of D_D012640. Although D_D006212 have not been reported as an adverse effect of this agent, we describe three patients who experienced complex D_D006212 and altered mental status after C_C022189 treatment was begun or its dosage increased. All three had been diagnosed earlier with D_D004827, and their electroencephalogram (EEG) findings were abnormal. During monitoring, D_D006212 did not correlate with EEG readings, nor did video recording capture any of the described events. None of the patients had experienced D_D006212 before this event. The only recent change in their treatment was the introduction or increased dosage of C_C022189. With either discontinuation or decreased dosage of the drug the symptoms disappeared and did not recur. Further observations and reports will help clarify this adverse effect. Until then, clinicians need to be aware of this possible complication associated with C_C022189.

title:GLEPP1 receptor C_D014443 phosphatase (Ptpro) in rat C_D011692 D_D009401. A marker of acute podocyte injury.
abstract:Glomerular epithelial protein 1 (GLEPP1) is a podocyte receptor membrane protein C_D014443 phosphatase located on the apical cell membrane of visceral glomerular epithelial cell and foot processes. This receptor plays a role in regulating the structure and function of podocyte foot process. To better understand the utility of GLEPP1 as a marker of D_D007674, the amount and distribution of GLEPP1 protein and mRNA were examined by immunohistochemistry, Western blot and RNase protection assay in a model of podocyte injury in the rat. C_D011692 D_D009401 was induced by single intraperitoneal injection of C_D011692 (C_D011692, 20 mg/100g BW). Tissues were analyzed at 0, 5, 7, 11, 21, 45, 80 and 126 days after C_D011692 injection so as to include both the acute phase of D_D011507 associated with foot process effacement (days 5-11) and the chronic phase of D_D011507 associated with D_D005921 (days 45-126). At day 5, GLEPP1 protein and mRNA were reduced from the normal range (265.2 +/- 79.6 x 10(6) moles/glomerulus and 100%) to 15% of normal (41.8 +/- 4.8 x 10(6) moles/glomerulus, p < 0.005). This occurred in association with an increase in urinary protein content from 1.8 +/- 1 to 99.0 +/- 61 mg/day (p < 0.001). In contrast, podocalyxin did not change significantly at this time. By day 11, GLEPP1 protein and mRNA had begun to return towards baseline. By day 45-126, at a time when glomerular scarring was present, GLEPP1 was absent from glomerulosclerotic areas although the total glomerular content of GLEPP1 was not different from normal. We conclude that GLEPP1 expression, unlike podocalyxin, reflects podocyte injury induced by C_D011692. GLEPP1 expression may be a useful marker of podocyte injury.

title:C_D013988-induced D_D000741: report of three Chinese patients and review of the literature.
abstract:In this study, three Chinese patients with C_D013988-induced D_D000741 were reported and another 13 patients in the English literature were reviewed. We attempted to find underlying similarities, evaluate the risk factors, and identify appropriate treatment for this complication. All but one of the patients were over 60 years old, and the 6 who died were all older than 65. Therefore, old age may be a risk factor for developing this complication. D_D000380 occurred 3-20 weeks after initiation of C_D013988, so frequent examination of white cell count during treatment is recommended. There seemed to be no direct correlation between the dose or duration used and the severity of D_D001855. Treatment for C_D013988-induced D_D000741 with colony-stimulating factors seemed to have little effect. The fact that 5 of the 6 patients who received concurrent C_D002118 channel blockers died, should alert clinicians to be more cautious when using these two drugs simultaneously.

title:Facilitation of memory retrieval by pre-test C_D009020 and its state dependency in the step-through type passive avoidance learning test in mice.
abstract:D_D000647 produced by C_D012601 and C_D003513 were reversed by C_D009020 given 30 min before the test trial (pre-test), and pre-test C_D009020 also facilitated the memory retrieval in the animals administered C_D009270 during the training trial. Similarly, pre-test C_D012601 partially reversed the C_D012601-induced D_D000647, but not significantly; and pre-test C_D003513 failed to reverse the C_D003513-induced D_D000647. These results suggest that the facilitation of memory retrieval by pre-test C_D009020 might be the direct action of C_D009020 rather than a state dependent effect.

title:Test conditions influence the response to a drug challenge in rodents.
abstract:These studies were conducted to examine the differential response to a drug challenge under varied experimental test conditions routinely employed to study drug-induced behavioral and neurophysiological responses in rodents. C_D001058, a nonselective C_D018491, was selected due to its biphasic behavioral effects, its ability to induce D_D007035, and to produce distinct changes to C_D004298 turnover in the rodent brain. From such experiments there is evidence that characterization and detection of C_D001058-induced activity in rodents critically depends upon the test conditions employed. In rats, detection of C_D001058-induced D_D006948 was facilitated by a period of acclimatization to the test conditions. Moreover, test conditions can impact upon other physiological responses to C_D001058 such as drug-induced D_D007035. In mice, C_D001058 produced qualitatively different responses under novel conditions when compared to those behaviors elicited in the home test cage. Drug-induced gross activity counts were increased in the novel exploratory box only, while measures of stereotypic behavior were similar in both. By contrast, C_D001058-induced locomotion was more prominent in the novel exploratory box. C_D004298 turnover ratios (C_D015102:C_D018491 and C_D006719:C_D018491) were found to be lower in those animals exposed to the exploratory box when compared to their home cage counterparts. However, C_D001058-induced reductions in striatal C_D004298 turnover were detected in both novel and home cage environments. The implications of these findings are discussed with particular emphasis upon conducting psychopharmacological challenge tests in rodents.
